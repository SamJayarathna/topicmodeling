  <p><img align="right" src="images/mrobillard_sm.jpg" alt="Martin Robillard"><img align="right" src="images/tbultan_sm.jpg" alt="Tefvik Bultan">FSE
  is recognized for the strength of its technical program, which is
  due to the quality of the submissions it attracts. As in previous
  years, we invited high-quality submissions describing significant,
  original, and unpublished results of theoretical and experimental
  software engineering research.</p>

  <p>We received 201 submissions to FSE 2012. This was a record high for
  the FSE conference. After a thorough review process, the FSE program
  committee selected 35 papers for presentation at the conference in
  November. The list of accepted papers can be found
  <a href="acceptedPapers.html">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Research Tool Demonstrations and New Ideas papers were also selected;
  the list of accepted tool demonstrations can be found 
  <a href="acceptedToolDemos.html">here</a> and the accepted New Ideas
  papers can be found <a href="acceptedNewIdeas.html">here</a>.</p>

   <p><img src="images/wtracz_sm.jpg" alt="Will Tracz, FSE-20 General Chair" align="right">
   ACM SIGSOFT 2012 (FSE-20) was held at the
   <a href="venue.html">Embassy Suites</a>
   in Cary, North Carolina (Research Triangle Park), USA.  Located
   in a wooded setting just minutes from the Raleigh-Durham International
   Airport and near Duke University, North Carolina State, and the
   University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and over 20 computer-related
   industries, this year's venue provided a convenient, easily accessible
   and relaxing environment to present new ideas and share experiences.</p>
   <p><b>Adam Lally</b>, IBM Senior
   Technical Staff Member on the DeepQA team that developed the Watson system,
   was one of our <a href="keynote.html">keynote speakers</a>, as were
   <b>Lori Clarke</b> of UMass Amherst, and <b>Chandrasekhar Boyapati</b> of
   Google, <b>Sarfraz Khurshid</b> of the University of Texas at Austin and
   <b>Darko Marinov</b> of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

   <p><b>From the SIGSOFT Past Chair</b></p>
   <p><img src="images/drosenblum_sm.png" alt="David S. Rosenblum, ACM SIGSOFT Chair" align="right">
   As Past Chair of ACM SIGSOFT, it was my pleasure to invite participation
   in the 20th annual offering of SIGSOFT's flagship conference, the core of
   which is the International Symposium on the Foundations of Software
   Engineering.  Since its inception in 1993 at Redondo Beach, FSE has served
   the software engineering community as a leading venue for dissemination of
   the latest ideas and results from the broad range of software engineering
   research.</p>
   <p>Will Tracz and his team produced an exciting week of 
   keynotes, technical talks, workshops and other activities.  I
   look forward to meeting you next time, at SIGSOFT 2014!</p>
