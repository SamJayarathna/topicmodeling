	content="Potential topics are those related to refactoring tools including, but not restricted to:
    * refactoring engines
    * improving the usability of existing refactoring engines
    * empirical studies about refactoring practice
    * tool performance
    * efficient representation of source models
    * program analyses for refactoring tools
    * tools for detecting applied refactorings
    * tools for suggesting refactorings (e.g., using code-smell detection)
    * testing and verification of refactoring tools
    * language-independent analysis frameworks and analytical representations
    * language-independent transformation frameworks
    * language-independent refactoring tools
    * refactoring tools for non-OO languages (e.g., functional languages, MDE, legacy languages)
    * composition and scripting of refactorings
    * medium- and large-scale refactorings (e.g. package-level, component-level)
    * refactoring for concurrency and parallelism">
