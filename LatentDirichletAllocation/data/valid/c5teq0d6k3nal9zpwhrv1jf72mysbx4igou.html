<h3>Some Features</h3>

<p>
Many activites will build the traditions of excellence established over many
years:
</p>


<ul>
<li>
<p>
<i>Workshops</i> are anticipated for Wednesday evening, Saturday afternoon,
and Sunday morning.  
</p>
<li>
<p>
<i>The Keynote Address</i>, given by the receipient of the 2001 SIGCSE
Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science Education, will
open the technical program on Thursday morning. 
</p>
<li>
<p>
The <i>SIGCSE Luncheon</i> at midday on Friday will introduce
the receipient of the 2001 SIGCSE Award for Service to SIGCSE and Computing
Education, as well as another stimulating speaker.
</p>
<li>
<p>
<i>Technical sessions</i> will continue between Thursday morning and
Saturday morning.
</p>
<li>
<p>
In addition to <i>papers</i> and <i>panels</i>, a new category of
<i>special sessions</i> will provide a flexible format for the presentation or
discussion of material. 
</p>
<li>
<p>
<i>Birds-of-a-Feather Sessions</i> are planned for Thursday evening, and the
<i>SIGCSE Business Meeting</i> will be held on Friday evening.
</p>
<li>
<p>
<i>Student research contest</i>, <i>faculty posters</i>, <i>exhibits</i>,
<i>first-timers' activities</i>, and a
<i>town meeting</i> will provide additional excitement and perspectives.
</p>
<li>
<p>
As in the past, a <i>roommate matching</i> coordinator will help facilitate 
attendees to find others with whom to share rooms.
</p>
</ul>

<h3>Breadth of Participants</h3>

<p>
Over the years, SIGCSE Symposia have drawn an increasingly diverse group of 
people interested in computer science education.  For example, for SIGCSE
2000, 18 of the 78 accepted papers and 82 referees were from outside the
United States (16 of 78 and 71, respectively, were from outside North America).
Additional efforts are planned, so that SIGCSE 2001 can be as inclusive and 
wide-ranging as possible.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<i>The Special Sessions</i> category for submissions will encourage those
with particular interests to organize a technical session with a specific
theme.
</p>
<li>
<p>
<i>Liaisons for Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Asia/Australia, Community
Colleges, and Secondary Schools</i> will provide guidance and encourage
participation for a wide range of groups.
</p>
</ul>
