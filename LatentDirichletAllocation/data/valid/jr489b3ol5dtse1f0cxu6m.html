<h1>8th Symposium on Identity and Trust on the Internet (IDtrust 2009)</h1>

<p>Theme: Authorization and Attributes</p>
<p>
This year IDtrust's annual symposium is more engaging and valuable 
than ever.  We have panels that approach the questions of the day from 
diverse viewpoints.  Topics include responding to the recent practical 
attacks on browser security and CAs that use md5 hashes; 
application-specific concerns; and the various alternatives for 
authentication, federation, authorization, and attribute management. 
</p><p> 
Keynote presentations will come from security and systems wizard Peter 
Neumann of SRI, and from Dan Blum, identity guru at the Burton Group, 
who has just finished a major independent review of Federal Identity 
Management Programs. 
</p><p> 
And of course as always we have cutting-edge researchers presenting 
new peer-reviewed papers on a wide variety of topics. 
</p><p> 
Come, network with your colleagues, and consider bringing your own 
short talk for the Rump session.

<h2>IDtrust</h2> 
<p>
IDtrust is devoted to research and deployment experience related to
making good security decisions based on identity information, especially
when public key cryptography is used and the human elements of usability
are considered.</p>
<p>
The success of any collaborative strategy depends on having
the right people gain access to the right information at the right time.
This implies that an IT infrastructure has - among other things - an
authorization framework in place that can respond to dynamic security
conditions and regulatory requirements quickly, flexibly and securely.
What are the authorization strategies that will succeed in the next
decade? What technologies exist to address complex requirements today?
What research is academia and industry pursuing to solve the problems
likely to show up in the next few years?</p>
<p>
In addition to peer-reviewed papers, we facilitate discussions among panels of invited experts and symposium participants.  This symposium was known as the
<a href="/pki07/">PKI R&amp;D Workshop</a> from 2002-2007.  </p>
