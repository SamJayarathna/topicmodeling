							<h2>WELCOME TO IDC 2009 WEB SITE!</h2>
							<div class="riga"></div>
							<p>For young people  today, technology is pervasive in many aspects of life. From childhood onwards, they learn and play using computers and other technological devices; as they grow, they build and maintain friendships using computers and mobile phones; they interact with one another virtually; and even find critical interpersonal support and therapy using computers, the web, and other technology-enhanced artifacts.</p>
							    The IDC 2009 conference will continue IDC's tradition of better understanding children&rsquo;s and youngsters&rsquo; needs in relationship to technology, exploring how to create interactive products for and with them, and investigating how technology-mediated experiences affect their life.
                            <p>IDC 2009  will present and discuss the most innovative contributions to research, development, and practice in these areas, gathering the leading minds in the field.</p>
							<p> As in previous years, IDC 2009  would like to invite researchers to address the wide diversification of technology for young people, from computers to mobile phones to any form of &ldquo;smart&rdquo; interactive device, and to consider the requirements of different profiles, in terms of age (from very young children to adolescents) and of psychological, social, or physical needs. In addition, IDC 2009 would like to foster an investigation of technological and methodological issues related not only to learning and play, but also to social awareness of young people in relationship to environment, cultural heritage, cultural roots of minorities, local identity vs. wider community identity. Finally, IDC 2009 would like to explore interaction design for young people in the family context and from an adult&rsquo;s perspective, e.g., how to help parents  understand and master the complexity of a scenario in which technology is more and more part of their children&rsquo;s life.</P>
							<p>The program will include full-day and half day workshops, invited talks by prestigious speakers, panels, papers sessions, posters and demos sessions. Social events will complement the scientific program and will be  a chance for participants to meet and discuss in the context of a gorgeous informal setting, and to build future collaborations.</p>
							<p>This conference builds on the successes and high standards of the previous IDC conferences (IDC 2008 in Chicago, US, IDC 2007 in Aalborg, Denmark, IDC 2006 in Tampere, Finland, IDC 2005 in Boulder, USA, IDC 2004 in Maryland, USA, IDC 2003 in Preston, UK and IDC 2002 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands).</p>
