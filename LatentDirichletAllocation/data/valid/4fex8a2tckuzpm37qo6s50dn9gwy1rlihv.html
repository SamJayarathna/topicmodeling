					Overview: The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum to 
					discuss new and emerging general-purpose programming 
					environments and platforms, as well as evaluate applications 
					that have been able to harness the horsepower provided by these 
					platforms.  This year's work is particularly interested on new 
					heterogeneous GPU platforms.   The final program can be found

                               Norman Rubin, AMD Fellow </b></h2><BR>
                               Abstract:  AMD recently introduced a new  GPU architecture: GCN (graphics core 
 next). This architecture is rolling out in discrete graphics cards now 
 and in APU processors in future years. The GCN core was designed from 
the ground up for modern graphics and compute workloads.
 For AMD, GCN is the biggest architecture overhaul since R600 in 2007.
 In GCN we moved to a new vector shader architecture, with high level 
 language support and unified caches. Heterogeneous computing is the 
key to power efficient processing for modern workloads beyond  graphics.
The GCN core in both discrete GPUs and APUs thrives on these 
workloads. <BR><BR>
This talk will look at GCN and will explain what changed and why.
The Radeon HD7970 is the first product to feature GCN. This is the 
 first graphics card based on a 28nm silicon node, the first to support 
dx 11.1, and the fastest single chip graphics card in the world.  Read 
 more about it

About the speaker:
Norm Rubin has over thirty  years of experience delivering commercial
compilers for processors ranging from embedded (ARM), desktop (HP,
ALPHA) and supercomputer (KSR), and is a recognized expert in the field. 
<BR><BR>
He was the architect and lead implementer for the widely used graphics
compiler for AMD/ATI. That compiler is currently shipping on millions of
machines including cell phones, consoles, and PCs.
For  the last several years, Norm has been part of the AMD architecture team
working on the design of  the next generation AMD system architecture where
he has been working on byte code language design.
<BR><BR>
Norm holds a PhD from the Courant Institute of NYU. Besides his work in
compilers, he is well known for his work in compiler related parts of the
tool chain, binary translators and dynamic optimizers.
