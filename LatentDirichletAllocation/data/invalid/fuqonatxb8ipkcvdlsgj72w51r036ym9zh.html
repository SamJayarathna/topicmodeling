	<section class="entry-post panel-body clearfix">
	<div class="entry-content"><p>There are various different ways to go <a href="http://dev2012.org/about/">about software development</a> it really doesn’t matter whether you are an experienced software developer or a novice one, as long as you have the right skill set and the right software, you are good to go.  However, one thing that needs to be remembered about software development is that, just like clothes, no one size fits all.</p>
<p>Over the years, by virtue of rapid development in this field, various tools have popped up to help in the development of software. When you are thinking of developing software, sooner or later, you will ask yourself, what infrastructure you need. Whether you are a part of an international collaboration, a multinational company or just a solo developer, the software that you use plays a crucial role and contributes greatly to the development.</p>
<p>Being a software developer builds up your skills day after day. If the right software is used for development, programming can be rewarding and fun.</p>
<p><strong>Software needed:</strong></p>
<p>Here is a list of the 8 most important software that are needed for software development:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit"><em>Devel</em>o</a><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit">pment kit</a>: </em>Depending upon the programming language that you are using, you would need a development kit. Different languages have different requirements. For example, you need a recent Java Development Kit or JDK which includes the Java runtime environment and the compiler.</li>
<li><em>Compiler: </em>A compiler is a program that converts code into executable machine language. Some popular C compilers are- Microsoft Visual Studio, Tiny C Compiler etc.</li>
<li><em>Text Editor: </em>A text editor can be used by inexperienced programmers. This is the minimum software requirement to program.</li>
<li>It simplifies the task of writing code. A simple text editor is easy to use and is therefore ideal for people who are new to coding. One shortcoming of using a text editor is that it has no advanced capabilities such as debugging or code completion. Some popular text editors are- Notepad++ for Windows, Emacs, and Sublime Text etc.</li>
<li><em>Integrated Development Environment</em>: Even though this is not absolutely necessary, most developers prefer using IDK instead of a text editor. These software combine the programs needed by developers into a suite that is convenient and comes with a graphical interface. Typically, it also includes a debugger. Popular IDKs are Eclipse, Netbeans, CodeLite etc.</li>
<li><em>Revision Control: </em>Also known as Version Control, is one of the most important software that a developer needs to use. It is actually a source code repository that allows you to retrieve any version of the code at any point of time. While working in a team, it allows all team members to work together efficiently without accidently deleting anyone’s code</li>
<li><em>Issue Tracker:</em> This is also known as ticketing system. It might appear to be a little intimidating at first but it is extremely useful during the development process. It can keep track of the bugs that are yet to be fixed.</li>
<li><em>Database Software:</em> Almost all software that you will develop will require a database to be built; this is why a database package is required. MySQL is a widely used database package as it is free and allows easy access of database using SQL queries.</li>
<li><em>Graphics Software: </em>Although this is not absolutely necessary, it is strongly recommended that you learn to use at least one graphics software.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above mentioned software, any developer can develop with ease.</p>

	<section class="entry-post panel-body clearfix">
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Every graduate with a computer science looks forward to working the in exciting world of professional programming. Most software developers have in depth knowledge of software development and expertise in programming as well as broad knowledge base of diverse areas like testing, team organization and customer interaction. Although there is no alternative for experience, reading is the next best thing for software developers.</p>
<p><strong>The best books:</strong></p>
<p>Here is a list of the 6 most popular books in the field.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>: </em>This book is a real eye opener for all developers. This book contains 46 tips for software developers that are absolutely indispensable. The Pragmatic Programmer does not go into the minute details of anything but it covers a wide array of basics that can transform a programmer into an employable software developer.</li>
<li><em>Continuous Delivery</em>: One of the most challenging and stressful parts of being a software developer is releasing software. This can be an extremely complex and error-prone part of programming and this book deals with it. Continuous Delivery describes real world examples and is an excellent read.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670"><em>Code Complete 2</em></a>: Anyone who enjoys programming must read this book. <img class="alignright wp-image-31 size-medium" src="http://dev2012.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Books-You-Should-Read-About-Software-Development-300x225.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="300" height="225" />Reading this book would help you to improve and reach greater heights.

<li><em>The Mythical Man Month: </em>This is ne classic and arguably the only one in the field of computers. This is a book about an obsolete operating system and surprisingly, it is still extremely relevant. The bottom line is that computers change but people don’t.</li>
<li><em>Clean Code </em>or <em>The Clean Coder: </em>These are two separate books but they are very similar in more ways than one. These are short books about how a programmer must conduct himself or herself in the professional world. They cover different aspects of being a professional software developer.</li>
<li><em>Don’t Make Me Think: </em>This is probably the best book based on reusability. Every important concept of usability has been covered in this book and it has been covered very well. Presented in a concise and approachable manner, this book is full of relevant information. The best part of this book is the wide audience base that it has. This book is equally relevant for technical and non technical readers, developers, managers as well as the users.</li>
<li><em>The Design of Everyday Things:</em> <a href="http://dev2012.org/tending-mobile-development-platforms/">Software development can be extremely tedious</a> and frustrating. This is because there is so much that can go wrong during the process of software development. Software developers need to anticipate things that can go wrong and work accordingly. This book teaches you how important it is to pay heed to the details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading a book is a major time investment so it is important to choose what you read wisely. Read these books carefully and do not omit any necessary concept and you are sure to benefit greatly from these books.</p>

	<section class="entry-post panel-body clearfix">
	<div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most exciting aspects of today is the flood of mobile applications that are churned out each day. Mobile players like Google, Apple and Windows are continuously competing and coming out with better and better applications for their users.</p>
<p>The world of communication is undergoing a phenomenal revolution. The whole perception of communication has been redefined due to the mobile application <a href="http://dev2012.org/6-books-you-should-read-about-software-development/">development platforms</a>. Each mobile platform is experiencing tough competition from rivals. Apple’s iOS was the market leader till a few years ago but today, other mobile platforms like Windows and Google Android also have a fair share of the market. All these are making their presence felt in the market and there is no denying that advancement in mobile technologies has helped individuals manage tasks without hassles. The growth in adoption of mobile technologies has been colossal and is still surging. Here are the three leading mobile platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Android</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Android based smart phones have been dazzling mobile device users for quite some time now. The demand for Android apps is increasing and this has encouraged developers to develop Android applications. Google Android is one of the most dominating mobile platforms today. The reason for Android’s popularity is the ease that it provides for mobile development. From business applications to non- business apps, the Android operating system is extremely versatile.</p>
<p>Customized applications can also be built for individual users. Android app is also extremely affordable as development is free and open source. This brings affordability into the product and hence there is a great rise in the popularity of Android apps. Android apps are user friendly and appealing and with the help of these apps, the user can enhance the performance of their mobile apps.</p>
<p><a href="http://dev2012.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/development-platforms.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28" src="http://dev2012.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/development-platforms.jpg" alt="development-platforms" width="640" height="348" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Even with the large number of mobile platforms, Windows application development has been surging ahead and becoming popular day by day. The Windows app development is now less complex.  The look and feel of Windows phones has been strategized by Microsoft and most users are comfortable with these Windows phones as the user interface is simple.

	<section class="entry-post panel-body clearfix">
	<div class="entry-content"><p>With the wide array of platforms, <a href="http://dev2012.org/8-software-for-development-you-must-have/">programming languages</a> and technologies available today, the question that is very often asked is how to become a better software developer? It is important to understand which skills are to be enhanced to be a good software developer. In today’s competitive world, it is quintessential to understand where and how to invest your time and resources.</p>
<p>The process of earning the reputation of a good software developer can be very challenging if you do not know exactly how to go about it and which skills to enhance. With the right skill set, you can triumph over all possible hurdles that you are likely to face.</p>
<p><a href="http://dev2012.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/programming-skills-in-demand.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-22 aligncenter" src="http://dev2012.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/programming-skills-in-demand.jpg" alt="programming-skills-in-demand" width="380" height="230" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong></p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://medium.com/@davidtucker/10-skills-developers-should-invest-in-for-2014-64eb28781489">five of the most essential skills</a> that are needed by software developers across the globe today:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Problem solving ability: </em>The importance of this skill can be understood by the fact that software development is completely and absolutely about problem solving. Software development wouldn’t even exist if there weren’t any problems that needed to be solved. The programming language or the technology doesn’t matter, if you are not a good problem solver, you wouldn’t be a good developer.</li>
<li><em>Passion for coding: </em>Most people would agree that coding is not something that can be taken lightly. Unless you develop a passion for coding, it is very unlikely to become a good developer. Only when you start enjoying coding, are you likely to get better and better at it. Start experimenting with codes and try to learn new things.</li>
<li><em>Good naming skills:</em> One basic thing that developers do is bring the unknown into existence. They give shape to their thought in the form of codes and software. It is important to give proper names to everything that exists in your code. Giving appropriate names in turn facilities your work.</li>
<li><em>Ability to learn: </em>This is probably one of the most important skills in life. You must accept that you cannot know everything about everything. Especially in a field that changes so rapidly. In this field, everything changes too fast and this is why you constantly need to learn. You need to adapt to changes very quickly.</li>
<li><em>Deal with people:</em> It is important to be able to deal with other developers and to understand their point of view. Apart from this, you also need to deal with customers and users as software is build for these people. Not know exactly what they want can have disastrous results and it wouldn’t make you a good software developer. You also need to be able to work with people as a team and express your ideas and views clearly.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is surely important to have sound technical knowledge and good programming skills to become a good software developer but these five skills, if enhanced properly would make you stand out of the crowd. You need to have a solid foundation and thorough knowledge of a few programming languages. When this knowledge is combined with the aforementioned skills, you become an excellent software developer.</p>

	<section class="entry-post panel-body clearfix">
	<div class="entry-content"><p>One of the best things about software development is that <a href="https://www.elance.com/r/contractors/q-Software%20Development">developers</a> can offer to work and develop software on contract basis, either part time or as a full time occupation. Independent contracting is the latest market trend and the ability to communicate freely, share ideas, connect with people and exchange money over the internet has worked wonders for contract based work.</p>
<p>If you have decided to hire a software developer on contract basis, there are a few things that you would need to consider. The employers need to pay attention to a lot of things to find the best software developer contractor who works according to their needs.</p>
<p><strong>Level of maturity and expertise</strong></p>
<p>Some contractors are more experienced and more skilled over the others. IT projects or software development requires a certain skill set and some contractors have more expertise in their field of work.</p>
<p>Consider different contractors and go through their previous work. Also, consider what they are offering to you before you choose any contractor. Typically, it is the contractor who supplies all work materials needed for software development, so make sure that the contractor is well versed with the needs of the project.<img class="size-full wp-image-12 aligncenter" src="http://dev2012.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/how-to-find-software-developer.jpg" alt="how-to-find-software-developer" width="361" height="226" /></p>
<p><strong>Intended duration</strong></p>
<p>Decide whether the <a href="http://dev2012.org/5-most-important-skills-developer-must-have/">contractor’s skills</a> are required for a short period of time or for a longer period. This must be done beforehand to avoid any confusion or conflict. Once the duration of the project has been decided, the contractor would let you know whether the contract can be done or not.</p>
<p>Contractors are generally hired on high costs so make sure the duration of the project does not exceed the estimated duration as this may be have adverse effects on your budget and development process.</p>
<p><strong>Tax implications</strong></p>
<p>If you are working in the United States, you need to consider the tax implications. After all, you as well as your contractor are working for monetary gains. Legally, the income from the contract needs to be reported to the IRS each April by both the parties.</p>
<p><strong>Probation</strong></p>
<p>Hiring someone on contract basis with the view of making the job permanent is a good way of attracting good contractors. This way, you can test the waters with the contractor hired by you and the contractor feels motivated to work better. If things work out well, you can hire the contractor on a permanent basis.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>
<p>With the fast pace of development and advancement in technology, you as well as your contractor need to be aware of the latest technologies that can be time saving, effective as well as beneficial. But in certain cases, the project requires old technology to be used. Make sure that the contractor you hire has in depth knowledge of the technology that is to be used.</p>
<p><strong>Is the contractor old enough?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing that needs to be considered is that is the contractor old enough to enter into a contract. In 47 states on US, the age of majority is 18 years but in some states like Nebraska, Alabama and Mississippi, it varies. A contract cannot be signed if the contractor does not meet the legal minimum age.</p>
<p>Recruiters are now hiring contractors for software development for easier and hassle free work. Make sure you hire the right contractor and your work would be made a lot easier for you.</p>
