<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
ICSE 2010, the 32nd International Conference on Software Engineering,
will be held from 2-10 May 2010, in Cape Town, South Africa, one of the
most beautiful places in the world.&nbsp; This workshop is a technical
meeting leading up to ICSE 2010.&nbsp; The purpose of the workshop is
to bring together researchers and practitioners from all over the
world, and especially from Africa, to share their knowledge about ICSE
and exchange research interests and experiences from practice in the
domain of software engineering (SE). This will open up many
opportunities for the local SE community.<br>
<br>
The two-day workshop will be held following the three-day IFIP Summer
School. Top international SE experts will deliver presentations on
research directions in specific areas. During the remainder of the
workshop, SE researchers and practitioners will have an opportunity to
present 15-minute statements of their interests, research achievements,
and plans. This will be followed by an interactive discussion to seek
common interests and potential cooperation in future research,
especially the presentation of that research at ICSE 2010.<br>
<br>
Taking advantage of this gathering of experts, the workshop will also
provide a unique opportunity for those in government and industry to
listen to advice and suggestions from leading-edge experts on how to
catch up with and surpass the current advances of the world’s software
industry, starting with postgraduate education all the way to top-level
research.<br>
<br>
As space and time are limited, only the early bird catches the
worm.&nbsp; Please register for your seat as soon as possible by
responding to the following calls on the submission site on
http://polelo.cs.up.ac.za/ISS2009 :<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="submissions" id="submissions"></a>SUBMISSIONS</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SHORT PAPERS</span>: Short papers (up
to four pages) describe research achievements and plans or practical
experiences that can be potentially developed into a full paper to be
submitted to ICSE 2010. The workshop committee members will review the
submitted papers, select papers to be presented at the workshop, and
return feedback to the authors.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">POSITION PAPERS</span>: Position
papers consist of one page summarizing the researcher or practitioner’s
current activity in the field of SE. Space permitting, all submitted
position papers will be accepted.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PROCEEDINGS</span>: All accepted short
papers will be published in an ACM Proceedings with a ISBN and will be
