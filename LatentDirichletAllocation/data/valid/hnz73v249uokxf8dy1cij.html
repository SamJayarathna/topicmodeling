<p> The Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)
provides an international forum for presentation and discussion of
research on information and knowledge management, as well as recent
advances on data and knowledge bases. The purpose of the conference is
to identify challenging problems facing the development of future
knowledge and information systems, and to shape future directions of
research by soliciting and reviewing high quality, applied and
theoretical research findings. An important part of the conference is
the Workshops program which focuses on timely research challenges and
initiatives. <P>
