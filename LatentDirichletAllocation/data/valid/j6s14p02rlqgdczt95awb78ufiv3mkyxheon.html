<h1>Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security</h1>


<p>The
    fourth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) will
    be held
July 23-25, 2008 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. This
symposium will bring together an interdisciplinary group of
researchers and practitioners in human computer interaction, security,
and privacy. The program features technical papers, workshops and tutorials, a
poster session, panels and invited talks, and discussion sessions.</p>

<h3>SOUPS 2008 Highlights</h3>

<p>SOUPS 2008 will begin with a  <a href =
							   "usm.html">Workshop
    on Usable IT Security Management (USM '08)</a> and
<a href = "soaps.html">The Symposium on Accessible Privacy and Security</a>.</p>

<p>During this three-day event, you'll have an opportunity to hear
  from people doing cutting edge research as well as from industry
  folks who will report on their first hand experiences with usable
  privacy and security challenges. The popular SOUPS poster session
  as well as social events, breaks, and discussion sessions will provide opportunities to
  share ideas and network with other participants.<p>

<p>The SOUPS 2008 <a href = "program.html#invited">invited talk</a>
will be given by Ross Anderson, one of the founders of a
vigorously-growing new discipline: the economics of information
security.</p>

<p>Continuing the tradition of interesting SOUPS social events, on Thursday
  evening SOUPS 2008 attendees will head to the
  <a href = "http://www.phipps.conservatory.org/index.html">
Phipps Conservatory</a> for dinner overlooking a lush tropical forest.</a></p>

<p>SOUPS 2008 will be held on the Carnegie Mellon University
  campus. <a href = "venue.html">Accommodations</a> have been reserved for SOUPS attendees at the
  nearby Holiday Inn as well as in the university dorms.</p> 

<h3>Not Your Typical Conference</h3>

<p>SOUPS distinguishes itself from other
  conferences by both providing a high quality technical program and
  by bringing together an interdisciplinary group of
  attendees in a format conducive to informal discussion and
  networking. SOUPS offers  reasonable registration fees, which
  include meals catered by local restaurants featuring a variety of
  cuisines. Past attendees have raved about "the amazing group of
  people who were here to talk with" and the "awesome food."
One past attendee wrote: <b>"Overall, this is the best conference I've attended. I may be ruined
forever going to SIGCHI and other larger conferences."</b></p>


<!--
  <p>The first formal gathering of researchers actively working in
  this interdisciplinary area took place at the <a href =
  "http://www.andrewpatrick.ca/CHI2003/HCISEC/">CHI 2003 Workshop on
  Human-Computer Interaction and Security Systems</a>. A larger <a
  href = "http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Workshops/Tools/">Workshop on
  Usable Privacy and Security Software (WUPSS)</a> was held at the
  DIMACS Center at Rutgers in July 2004. WUPSS participants expressed
  a desire for an event that would combine a refereed papers track
  with less formal research discussions. In July 2005 the <a href = "../2005/">first SOUPS
  conference</a> took place in Pittsburgh, PA. It was followed by a
  <a href = "../2006/">second SOUPS conference</a> in July 2006.</p>
