				We invite submissions to the 2015 ACM/SIGEVO Foundations of
				Genetic Algorithms XIII (FOGA 2015)
				which will be held 17&ndash;20&nbsp;January&nbsp;2015 in Aberystwyth, Wales, UK.
			</p>
			<p>
				FOGA is the premier event on the theoretical foundations of
				evolutionary computation and all kinds of randomised search
				heuristics, including but not limited to evolutionary algorithms,
				ant colony optimisation, artificial immune systems and particle
				swarm optimisation. Accepted papers will be published in
				post-conference proceedings by ACM Press.
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal of FOGA is to advance the theoretical understanding
				of evolutionary computation and all kinds of randomised search
				heuristics, promote theoretical work to the wider community and
				contribute to making randomised search heuristics more useful
				in practice. We particularly encourage submissions bridging
				theory and practice. In addition to strict mathematical
				investigations, experimental studies contributing towards the
				theoretical foundations of evolutionary computation methods are
				also welcome. Topics include but are not limited to runtime
				analysis; fitness landscapes and problem difficulty; single-
				and multi-objective optimisation problems; stochastic and
				dynamic environments; population dynamics; statistical
				approaches; self-adaptation; black-box complexity; working
				principles of all kinds of randomised search heuristics.

			<h2>Submission</h2>
			<p>
				Authors should submit their papers (15 page maximum) consistent
				with the alternate ACM SIG style file (see
				<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates"
				target="_blank">
				acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates
				</a>
				to obtain the class file and see templates) by the submission
				deadline.
				Submissions are made through
				<a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=foga2015"
				target="_blank">
				EasyChair
				</a>.
				Preliminary versions of the accepted papers will be distributed
				to participants at FOGA.
				Authors of papers presented at the FOGA workshop will be asked
				to contribute final versions of their papers as part of the
				post-conference proceedings published by ACM.
