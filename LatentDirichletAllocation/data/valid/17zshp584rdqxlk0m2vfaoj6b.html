<P> As embedded systems increase in number, complexity, and diversity, new research challenges are encountered in areas such as verification, validation, meeting performance goals and resource constraints, creating and exploiting new hardware architectures, and scaling up to multicores and distributed systems built from multicores. 

</P><P> LCTES 2009 solicits papers presenting original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, and architectures that help meet these challenges. Research papers (which propose innovative techniques) and experience papers (which report experimentation with and lessons learned from real-world systems and applications) are both welcome. 

</P><P> In addition to its regular sessions, LCTES 2009 will feature special events such as an industrial panel, keynotes, tutorials and demonstrations to bring out the latest and more interesting aspects of embedded systems. Examples include tools for multi-cores, emerging platforms such as smart phones, multi-player game machines and autonomous vehicles and embedded supercomputing. 

</P><P>Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following aspects of embedded and cyber physical systems design:

<LI> Programming language issues in embedded systems, including 
<UL>
<LI> Language features to exploit multi-core, single-chip SIMD, reconfigurable architecture and other emerging architectures
</LI><LI>  Language features for distributed real-time control, media players, and other complex embedded systems
