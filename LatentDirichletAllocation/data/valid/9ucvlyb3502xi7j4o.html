<p>Peoples’ choices as to what products they use—from cars to games to word processors—are increasingly determined by the human factors of the software they contain. EICS 2009 will communicate innovative engineering approaches for enhancing the usability and entertainment value of interactive systems. We invite your papers, experience reports and demonstrations on software processes, tools and techniques for the engineering of interactive computing systems, and look forward to seeing you in Pittsburgh in July 2009!</p>

<p><strong>EICS</strong> (the <strong>ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computing Systems</strong>) is a new international conference devoted to all aspects of the engineering of usable and effective interactive computing systems, ranging from traditional workstation-based interactive systems to those involving new and emerging modalities (<em>e.g.</em>, gesture), applications (<em>e.g.</em>, mobile and ubiquitous games) and development methods (<em>e.g.</em>, extreme programming).</p>
<p>EICS focuses on tools, techniques and methods for designing and developing interactive systems. EICS brings together people who study or practice the engineering of interactive systems, drawing from the HCI, Software Engineering, Requirements Engineering, CSCW, Ubiquitous / Pervasive Systems and Game Development communities.</p>
<p>EICS is the continuation of the successful <strong>EHCI</strong> (Engineering of Human Computer Interaction) series of conferences sponsored by IFIP Working Group 2.7/13.4. In addition, EICS 2009 will incorporate the 16th International Workshop on the Design, Specification and Verification of Interactive Systems (<strong>DSV-IS 2009</strong>).</p>
