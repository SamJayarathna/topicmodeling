<h1>Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security</h1>


<p>The
    third Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) will
    be held
July 18-20, 2007 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. This
symposium will bring together an interdisciplinary group of
researchers and practitioners in human computer interaction, security,
and privacy. The program features technical papers, workshops and tutorials, a
poster session, panels and invited talks, and discussion sessions.</p>

<h3>SOUPS 2007 Highlights</h3>

<p>SOUPS 2007 will begin with a  <a href =
							   "usm.html"><b>Workshop
    on Usable IT Security Management</b> (USM '07)</a> and
							   <a href = "program.html#tutorials"><b>usability testing and security protocols			 tutorials</b></a>
designed to introduce these topics to researchers who don't
 have a background in these areas.</p>

<p>During this three-day event, you'll have an opportunity to hear
  from people doing cutting edge research as well as from industry
  folks who will report on their first hand experiences with usable
  privacy and security challenges. The popular SOUPS poster session
  as well as social events, breaks, and discussion sessions will provide opportunities to
  share ideas and network with other participants.<p>

<p>SOUPS 2007 will delve into an area where usability,
    privacy, and security are all of critical importance with an <b><a href = "program.html#invited">invited
    talk</a> on ballot and election design</b> by award-winning graphic
    designer Marcia Lausen. Panel discussions will focus on another
    important area: two-factor authentication for financial services. </p>

<p>Continuing the tradition of interesting SOUPS social events, on Thursday
  evening SOUPS 2007 attendees will head to the
  <a href = "http://www.paaclub.org/Club/Scripts/Home/home.asp">
 Pittsburgh
  Athletic Association</a> for dinner and an evening of bowling at the
  PAA's <a href = "http://www.paaclub.org/club/scripts/section/section.asp?GRP=1266&NS=BOF">private bowling facility.</a></p>

<p>SOUPS 2007 will be held on the Carnegie Mellon University
  campus. <a href = "venue.html">Accommodations</a> have been reserved for SOUPS attendees at the
  nearby Holiday Inn as well as in the university dorms.</p>

<h3>Not Your Typical Conference</h3>

<p>SOUPS distinguishes itself from other
  conferences by both providing a high quality technical program and
  by bringing together an interdisciplinary group of
  attendees in a format conducive to informal discussion and
  networking. SOUPS offers  reasonable registration fees, which
  include meals catered by local restaurants featuring a variety of
  cuisines. Past attendees have raved about "the amazing group of
  people who were here to talk with" and the "awesome food."
One past attendee wrote: <b>"Overall, this is the best conference I've attended. I may be ruined
forever going to SIGCHI and other larger conferences."</b></p>


<!--
  <p>The first formal gathering of researchers actively working in
  this interdisciplinary area took place at the <a href =
  "http://www.andrewpatrick.ca/CHI2003/HCISEC/">CHI 2003 Workshop on
  Human-Computer Interaction and Security Systems</a>. A larger <a
  href = "http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Workshops/Tools/">Workshop on
  Usable Privacy and Security Software (WUPSS)</a> was held at the
  DIMACS Center at Rutgers in July 2004. WUPSS participants expressed
  a desire for an event that would combine a refereed papers track
  with less formal research discussions. In July 2005 the <a href = "../2005/">first SOUPS
  conference</a> took place in Pittsburgh, PA. It was followed by a
  <a href = "../2006/">second SOUPS conference</a> in July 2006.</p>
