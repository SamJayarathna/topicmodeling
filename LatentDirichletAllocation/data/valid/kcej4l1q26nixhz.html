<P>
The ACM SIGPLAN 2003 Workshop on Interpreters, Virtual Machines and
Emulators (IVME 03) provides a venue to bring together researchers and
practitioners on interpreters, virtual machine design, emulators and
machine simulators. The theme of the workshop includes novel research
on new techniques, as well as experience reports on innovative real
systems and applications.<p>

<CENTER><H2>Topics</H2></CENTER>

Papers are solicited in areas including, but not limited
to, the following:<p>
<br>
<ul>
<LI> Interpreter optimisations
<LI> Virtual machine design
<li> Virtual machines for code compression
<LI> Machine emulators
<LI> Processor simulators
<LI> Interpreters for embedded systems
<LI> Mixed-mode interpretive/compiled systems
<LI> Hardware support
<LI> Portable (retargetable) interpreters
<LI> Interpreters for very high-level languages
<LI> Simplicity, maintainability and correctness issues
<LI> Software engineering aspects (e.g. cost, time to market)
<LI> Experience reports
</ul>
<br>
<P>
<p>
In principle, any topic relating to the design or implementation of
interpreter-based systems is suitable for this workshop. If there is
any doubt about the suitability of a given topic for the workshop,
please contact the program chair for confirmation.<br>
<br>

<CENTER><h2>Submission Information</h2></CENTER>

Please submit your paper electronically via the workshop web site.
The final versions of papers will be formatted according the ACM
proceedings format and will be no longer than 8 pages in this
format. This 8 pages includes everything (i.e., it is the total
length of the paper). Templates for ACM format are available for
Latex, Word Perfect, and Microsoft Word are located at
http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html. Submitted
versions of papers do not have to use this format, but should not
be excessively long.<br>
<br>
Submissions should be in PDF or Postscript (preferred) that is
interpretable by Ghostscript and printable on US Letter and A4 sized
paper. Papers already being reviewed by another conference or workshop
are not eligible. If a closely related paper has been submitted to a
journal, the authors must notify the program chair.<br>
<br>
The proceedings of the workshop will be published in the ACM Digital
Library. Attendees at the workshop will receive a soft-bound copy of
the proceedings. The proceedings are also under consideration for
publication as a special issue of SIGPLAN Notices, but no decision
has yet been reached.<br>
<br>
The deadline for submissions was extended to Thursday March 13th
2003 at 12 noon GMT. This extended dealine was firm. Paper submission
is now closed. Thanks for your interest in IVME 03.<br>
