</div><p>We invite you to join us in Lake Buena Vista, Florida (near Orlando) for the Association of
		  Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on University and
		  College Computing Services (SIGUCCS) 2007 Fall Conference!  The 
		  conference is being held at The Hilton Resort at <em>Walt Disney World</em><span class="trademark">&reg;</span>, just steps from  the <em>Downtown Disney</em><span class="trademark">&reg;</span> area, October 7 - 10, 2007. Of the many things associated with <em>Walt Disney World</em><span class="trademark">&reg;</span> - family fun, learning,
          theme parks, entertainment - the magic of Disney<span class="trademark">&reg;</span> stands out.
          Cinderella Castle, Tinkerbell and the Sorcerer's Apprentice are but a
          few of the well-known and well-loved parts of the Disney<span class="trademark">&reg;</span> magic. This
            year's Fall Conference theme, &quot;Inspiring Magical Outcomes&quot; fits with our
         Disney<span class="trademark">&reg;</span> locale.</p>
   
<a href="pre-conference.html" ><img src="images/callout_Workshops.png" align="left" alt="Sharpen your skills! Pre-conference workshops are on October 8!" /></a>
<p>While we gather to discuss computing services, we'll be
          sharing the magical outcomes we have inspired in others at our schools
          and will be inspiring magical outcomes amongst each other. We encourage
          everyone to reflect on enchantments this year as we explore Disney<span class="trademark">&reg;</span> and
          beyond. We will discover new approaches to ever-present and new
          Computing Services challenges such as supporting our customers while
          faced with limited resources, training of users and staff, hiring and
          retaining good technical and managerial staff, providing top-notch help
          desk support at all times, advancing the pedagogical use of technology,
          working at the bleeding edge, anticipating the bleeding edge, managing
          tipping points, and so forth.</p>
        <p>The services we provide day-to-day are not unlike services provided by
          other fields - banks, hotels, restaurants, churches, museums, theme
          parks, etc. We all try to provide our special services to the customer
          in a positive way, we plan for the future, we anticipate needs, we
          develop the needed infrastructure, and we try to advance our fields.</p>
        <p>This year's program will inspire new ideas and magical outcomes. You
          most assuredly will leave with more wizardry than when you arrived! We
          also encourage you to actively participate! Check the links at the left
          for all the details. We look forward to seeing you at <em>Walt Disney World</em><span class="trademark">&reg;</span>, Florida for
          SIGUCCS 2007!</p>
        <p>We encourage you to take advantage of the special extended conference
          hotel rates that have been accorded to SIGUCCS participants by coming 
          a few days early or staying additional days. Using this approach, you 
          can take full advantage of the professional learning environment SIGUCCS 
          offers, and also sample the local recreational fare while you're there.</p>
        <p>Your 2007 Fall Conference Core-Committee, Jayne Ashworth, Melissa Bauer,
          Lisa Brown and Carol Rhodes. </p>
