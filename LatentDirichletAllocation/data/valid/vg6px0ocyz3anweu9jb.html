<H3>Hot Topic Sessions and Pre-Conference Tutorials</H3>

New this year, <A
HREF="http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/~bhelm/poirot/hot-topics.html">Hot
Topic</A> sessions provide groups of authors the opportunity to
present and discuss their recent results in specific areas. Also,
there will be a series of 1.5 and 3 hour pre-conference tutorials that
permit a more detailed presentation of innovative methods and
research.

<H3>PAPER Sessions</H3>

Papers describing the application of performance evaluation techniques 
to computer system design, new techniques, or extensions to existing 
techniques are presented. Also presented are original case studies in
which performance evaluation techniques have been usefully applied.

<H2><A NAME="location">LOCATION</H2>

<H3><A HREF="http://www.digimark.net:80/iatech/tour/">Ottawa</A>, Ontario, Canada</H3>

Ottawa, Canada's capital city, is home to many unique Canadian
institutions, to fine museums, and monuments of national
significance. Ottawa is set against the backdrop of flowing rivers and
a canal. There is an abundance of green space which gives Ottawa a parkland 
atmosphere unlike any other capital city in the world. 
 <P>
In mid-May, the city is brightened by a brilliant display
of spring tulips that cover the city. Princess (later Queen) 
Juliana of the Netherlands and her family took refuge in Ottawa 
during World War II. When the family returned home, they presented 
Ottawa with a huge gift of bulbs. Since then, more than 10,000 bulbs 
have arrived every year. Now, in spring, the capital is carpeted 
with the colour of over 1,000,000 tulips! 
 <P>
The conference hotel is very central, next to the Rideau Canal and the 
Byward Market. The market is 150 years old and is a center for boutiques, 
restaurants, and entertainment. The hotel is within walking 
distance of many fine restaurants, good shopping, the spectacular 
Parliament Buildings, and many of Ottawa's museums and other 
attractions. There are many other hotels near by including
the Lord Elgin, and Novotel. 
 <P>
Also during May-June, Ottawa will host a world-wide celebration of the 
50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Because of the 
unpredictable effect of this latter event on hotel space, you are urged 
to book your hotel room early!

<H3>Climate</H3>

The weather in Ottawa in May is variable. Daytime temperatures between
50F-70F (12-20C) are typical, with temperatures as low as 40F (5C)
in the early morning and evening.

<H3>Exchange Rate</H3>

At the time of this message, one Canadian dollar $1CA = $0.74US.

<H3>Conference Site</H3>

All technical sessions, lunches, and registration will be held at
the Westin Hotel. The alternative hotels are within walking distance
of the conference hotel and are listed below.

<H3>Air Travel</H3>

From the USA, direct flights to Ottawa's MacDonald-Cartier International 
Airport are available from Baltimore, Newark, LaGuardia, Boston, Pittsburgh, 
and Washington. Most other flights from the USA, Europe, and from Pacific 
rim countries require a change at Pearson International Airport in 
Toronto or Mirabel International Airport in Montreal. If you have
a choice come via Toronto. There are direct flights to Ottawa from 
London England, Amsterdam, and Paris.

<H3>Transportation</H3>

A taxi from the MacDonald-Cartier Airport to the downtown hotels
is approximately CA$20. An airport bus is also available.
 <P>
Many flights from Europe arrive at Montreal's Mirabel Airport. 
There are buses from Mirabel to Ottawa, but it is preferable
to make a connecting flight. 
 <P>
For those renting a car at Ottawa's MacDonald-Cartier International Airport: 
follow the airport parkway to Colonel By Drive (just after the entrance 
to Carleton University). Turn right (east) on Colonel By Drive. The Westin is
located just before the intersection of Colonel By Drive and Rideau Street 
(about 3 miles (5km) from the right turn).
