<h1>NordiCHI 2012</h1>
<div class="textblock">
	<p>Nordi<span class="acr">CHI</span>2012 is the 7th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction. Previous conferences have been held in Reykjavik 2010, Lund 2008, Oslo 2006, Tampere 2004, &Aring;rhus 2002, Stockholm 2000.</p>
	<p>Interaction Design has over the years contributed significantly to the field of Human-Computer Interaction <span class="acr">(HCI)</span> by elevating the importance of user experience, design practices, creativity, participation, and more. Nordi<span class="acr">CHI</span> 2012 wants to recognise the vitality of the design community in our regions including top-level education, world-class industrial and artistic design, and its cultural relevance.</p>
	<p>As new <span class="acr">IT</span> continues to change our perception of time and space, we need to look at situations with a new mindset. In the 18:4 issue of <span class="acr">ACM</span> Interactions, Liam Bannon notes "how <span class="acr">HCI</span> has moved from evaluation of interfaces through design of systems and into general sense-making of our world". Nordi<span class="acr">CHI</span> 2012 embraces this explorative yet down-to-earth challenge of designing interactive systems for human practices that are still in the making.</p>

	Twenty academics and practitioners are invited to participate in a workshop in which we will explore various aspects of a practitioner-oriented template to describe methods for User Centered Design (UCD). The workshop starts with a theoretical background about method descriptions and user needs and preferences with regard to such descriptions. This is followed by an introduction to the online platform UCDtoolbox.com which facilitates method selection and where detailed information about UCD methods and tools can be obtained. Participants are asked to evaluate a number of the current method descriptions included in the UCDtoolbox and synthesize additional requirements for future versions of method descriptions.

	This half-day workshop builds upon previous work by the authors in understanding and designing for teenagers where the initial concern was to understand cool. Expanding out from this work, the workshop proposers now seek to better understand all the activities around designing for teenagers – these being – gathering requirements from teenagers, iterating designs with teenagers, and evaluating with teenagers. This is a currently underrepresented population in Interaction Design yet it is an area where rich insights can be gained. This workshop aims to gather a deeper understanding of the design space around teenagers whilst also distilling the similarities and differences in terms of similar approaches for children and adults.

	User Experience (UX) is an ongoing process and should not be limited to a single use situation. However, this is unfortunately often the case in HCI research. The goal of this workshop is to deepen and expand available knowledge with respect to temporal dynamics of UX. Relevant aspects will be the understanding of how UX is evolving over time, in particular across products and contexts, as well as the exploration of methods that can evaluate long-term UX in practice. For this, the organizers will prepare a booklet that introduces existing models and methods for long-term UX as a mutual basis for discussing critical experience phases that should be taken into consideration in product development. The booklet also summarizes pre-notes from participants, which will be collected prior to the workshop. In addition, during an interactive group activity, participants will reflect on the diversity of long-term UX of different product types. Participants from academia as well as from industry are invited in order to tackle the question of how to make research results and methods applicable in practice.

	Due to increasing specialization in organizations and multidisciplinary team work, boundaries are becoming more explicit obstacles. Boundary objects have been proposed as means for crossing these boundaries. This workshop provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to share experiences and issues with crossing boundaries in multidisciplinary innovation projects. In particular, we seek to bring together people who have studied, built, or used boundary objects to facilitate communication across boundaries within or among teams, departments, companies, as well as design phases. The aim of the workshop is twofold. First, to draw a landscape of perspectives, experiences, and contributions regarding boundary crossing and gain understanding how artefacts can be used for boundary crossing highlighting their individual strengths and weaknesses. Second, to uncover what design (communication) can do in crossing these boundaries.<br />

	Engaging the audience has always been of fundamental importance to the creative sector (performing and visual arts, video games, film, interactive narrative etc). As more and more interactive technologies are employed to involve the audiences in all steps of the creation process, from audience journeys to models of co-creation, the value of the design process itself has become more central to achieving audience engagement. However, knowledge of methods and process for designing and evaluating audience engagement remains fragmented and incomplete. Acknowledging this lack of a coherent framework, the workshop will take an interdisciplinary approach to identify design strategies for audience engagement.

<div class="wshopDescr">
	Research in the area of intelligent healthcare systems has reached a point where significant improvements are only possible if academics and practioners from various disciplines collaborate in order to develop new strategies for conceptualizing, designing, and implementing new applications. The underlying strategies must be harmonized and balanced in two ways: first, within the technological areas, and second, regarding the integration of technologies into the medical, cognitive, and social context. This also includes the way technology acts within the life courses of individuals and societies, and the balance of the benefits that technology brings against perceived or actual medical, social as well as ethical drawbacks. Therefore, this workshop aims to bring together researchers and industry practitioners from different fields to share their research positions and practical experiences and discuss new ideas, innovative approaches and challenging research questions, which have the potential to motivate future research activities within the field of intelligent healthcare systems.

	Complex mediation structures in new and evolving fields of IT-use, liquefy the distinction between tool and material. Tools turn into materials, and objects of interest become instrumental mediators in the process of developing innovative use of software and in reshaping software itself. By changing perspective from triadic subject-instrument-object mediation to complex meditational structures, an analytical sensitivity for the evolving material qualities of software in use is opened. The goal of the workshop is to inspire and further discussions and new perspectives in the intersection between understanding the materiality of computing technologies and notions of participation in use and in design.

	Interactive learning environments can roughly be grouped in two: 1) graphic models of natural (physical, biological) phenomena and 2) social learning environments. The first is about user interfaces for learners to interact with simulations of aspects of reality (e.g. how a heat pump works). These are increasingly used as educational tools in science classrooms (de Jong, 2006; Holzinger et al., 2009). The other type is learning environments for social interaction, collaboration and inquiry (Rubens et al., 2005), and guided by conceptual frameworks like progressive inquiry and cultures of participation (Jenkins, 2006; Fischer 2009). These environments are also used outside of classrooms (e.g. Wikipedia). We see both kinds of learning environments as essential for full support of learning as they complement each other in significant ways. In this workshop we aim to explore their synergy and bring together researchers working in one or the other field with an interest in synthesizing previous work and developing a research agenda for integrated learning environments. We welcome both design proposals and empirical studies. The workshop has two additional goals: to investigate common possibilities for publication and to identify possible project ideas for further work.

	This one day workshop addresses current needs in the area of interactive broadcasting, scriptwriting, experience design, game design and transmedia storytelling, where experiences are extended across media types, platforms and environments. While interactive content consumption changes the ways in which we experience stories, existing content seldom manages to flow from non- interactive to interactive elements beautifully. In order to deal with potential media-discontinuity it is suggested to create “seamless” designs; however, there is little existing literature that deals with media-discontinuity within transmedia experiences. This workshop intends to bring together practitioners and researchers from various disciplines such as traditional storytellers, scriptwriters, broadcasters, 3D content producers, user experiences designers, game designers and TV producers in order to share experiences, discuss and further define seams in experiences for this emerging interdisciplinary new genre.

	This workshop will discuss and map-out the challenges posed by differences between the clinic and the home setting, for the design of digital technology for self-care. We aim to bring together researchers and professionals from HCI and design, and care- organizations to share their insights and experiences of being involved in various cases. We take these shared insights as the basis for exploring how the differences of various settings may influence the design of digital technology for self-care. We will collect these different perspectives in the form of selected position papers, posters, and summary of plenary discussions, and share it as an online repository for HCI researchers, professionals and students.

	Trust is increasingly important in several information communication technology (ICT) related areas. Nevertheless, there is still no unified definition of trust in technologies. In the presented full day workshop we want to bring researchers, experts, and practitioners together to discuss and create a more unified understanding and definition of trust, as well as related research areas and methods, as a basis for a working community. The main outcome of the workshop is the creation of a working definition of trust and the exchange and introduction to research and methods related to user-centered trust in interactive systems.

	Data visualization has been a big interest among interaction designers thanks to the advances of visualization authoring tools. With the tools including programming languages, visualization generation websites, and open source libraries, interaction designers can easily create data visualization harnessing their prototyping skills and aesthetic sensibility. However, there still exist some technical and methodological challenges for interaction designers in jumping into the scene. In this workshop, we discuss new roles of designers in this interdisciplinary field, and the ways of using and enhancing visualization tools to support designers. We encourage experts in the intersection of data visualization and interaction design to share their experiences in designing interactive visualizations in both industry and academic contexts.

	User Experience (UX) is an emerging research area pertaining to as well as extending beyond the traditional usability. Issues in the realm of usability may be amplified in UX because of its larger scope. Four key non-orthogonal issues are: definition, modeling, method selection, and interplay between evaluation and development. Leveraging the legacy of a series of earlier workshops, I-UxSED 2012 aims to develop a deeper understanding of how evaluation feedback shapes software development, especially when experiential qualities such as fun, trust, aesthetic values are concerned. Is feedback on these fuzzy qualities less useful for problem prioritization or less persuasive for problem fixing? This and other challenging questions will be explored in I-UxSED 2012 that brings together researchers and practitioners from two communities - HCI and Software Engineering.

	Knowledge management has been recognized as a challenging, and sometimes deeply problematic term, which still remains to attract much attention in large areas of information systems and management science research. It has, however, being going largely under the radar of the HCI community, except perhaps in sporadic references to expert systems. The field is much broader, however, and we believe that is a systematic re-examination of it from a fresh angle. Not only is, the need to build IT solutions that support a knowledge-based way of work is greater than ever, but we also see the idea of knowledge being entertained as central in life outside work.

		Information and communication technologies (ICT) are often designed under the implicit assumption that members of different cultures using different languages equally view a given functionality as appropriate for carrying out a given, or that another member observing a given act in an ICT environment interprets it as originally intended by the actor. Given that culture, language, cognition, and action are intricately intertwined, in a technology driven multi‐cultural and multi‐lingual world, it is an open empirical research problem that the human computer interaction (HCI) design and development aspects of ICT and collaboration systems still permeate with ethnocentric assumptions.
	</p><p>
		This comprehensive one‐day tutorial will consider the concept of culture, the different theoretical approaches and methodological traditions in social sciences with regard to investigating culture, their relevance to HCI, and the practical implications to Cross‐Cultural HCI research and practice. This tutorial seeks to systematically examine similarities and differences in the ICT lifecycle (design, development, deployment, adoption, use, impact, and evaluation) across different contexts such as cultures, languages, regions, nations, generations, socio‐economic classes, genders, organizations, and technologies. The objective of this tutorial is to develop increased understandings of the ways in which people appropriate ICTs, relate to, interact with, and form impression of each other via ICTs. The tutorial focus is on creating increased understanding and heightened awareness of research in and practice of ICT both locally and globally.

		In today’s telecom business, empowered users are getting harder than ever to win and keep. No one can afford not to use user-centred design and development approaches. However, delivering a great user experience in the simplest possible way is often a complex task. To succeed, one must understand and translate user needs, expectations, technical opportunities, and constraints into an adequate design. It requires developing solutions using user-centered design approaches where design, implementation and evaluations are performed in an iterative fashion. It involves cross-competences from project stakeholders such as interaction designers, application/product planners, software developers, system architects, marketing staff, managers and user researchers. These competences are involved in the design process, thus better contributing to a valid and feasible design, and helping designers to take the solution forward. 
	</p><p>
		The aim of the tutorial is to provide the participants with a clearer definition of User eXperience, but also processes, frameworks, tools and ways of working to translate User eXperience into successful and appealing design. Participants will get an insight into the issues that surround the development of services and application and how to approach these from a user experience design point of view. The tutorial is based on the latest research and hands-on development of fix and mobile services at one of the telecommunication industry's largest companies. Its content has been developed and refined by the instructors based on experience gained over a period of several years while they have been employed in the telecom industry.

	<p>
		More than 20 years ago, Fred Brooks asked1: "is interface design itself an area of research, producing generalizable results?" He elaborated that a major issue that confuses and puzzles the human-computer interaction community is the tension between narrow truths proved convincingly by statistically sound experiments, and broad "truths", generally applicable, but supported only by possibly unrepresentative observations. That is, results indisputably true but disputably applicable, and results indisputably applicable but perhaps over-generalized. Brooks' question is still relevant.
	</p><p>
		In this tutorial, we will describe the view that the design of complex and novel interactive systems can itself be an area of research, complementing other forms of research, and that it is capable of producing useful and trustworthy results. We call this form of research design-based research, a method of inquiry aimed at exploiting the opportunities that design of complex interactive systems provides to advance our understanding about the problem we are solving, process we are following, and solution we are building. While many designers and researchers already conduct this form of research, and the idea of design-based research is not new2, up to date, there have not been many attempts to explicitly define this method. The main goal of the tutorial is to give participants better understanding about the scope and limitations of design-based research, and help them to critically review contributions of this kind.

		HCI research has for long been dedicated to better and more naturally facilitating information transfer between humans and machines. Unfortunately, humans' most natural form of communication, speech, is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines – despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the NordiCHI community has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the relatively discouraging levels of accuracy in understanding speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces.
	</p><p>
		The goal of this course is to inform the NordiCHI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and speech synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms.</p>
	<div class="wshopAudience">
		<span class="wsaTitle">Intended audience</span>
		The tutorial will be beneficial to all NordiCHI researchers or practitioners without a strong expertise in AASR or TTS, who still believe in fulfilling HCI's goal of developing methods and systems that allow humans to naturally interact with the ever increasingly ubiquitous mobile technology, but are disappointed with the lack of success in using speech and natural language to achieve this goal.

		Participants in this course will learn how to conduct empirical research in human-computer interaction (HCI). As most attendees at HCI conferences will agree, a "user study" is the hallmark of good research in human-computer interaction. But, what constitutes a user study? By and large, a user study is an experiment conforming to the norms for empirical inquiry and the scientific method. It is founded on observation, measurement, and posing and answering testable research questions. 
	</p><p>
		Attendees will learn about independent variables, dependent variables, within- and between-subjects conditions, counterbalancing, internal validity, external validity, etc. The course will also include an introduction to the most common statistical tool used for hypothesis testing in HCI: the analysis of variance. No prior experience or statistical knowledge is necessary. An ANOVA tool, written by the presenter in Java, will be provided to attendees through the course’s web site (URL to follow). In short, this course delivers an A-to-Z tutorial on conducting an empirical experiment (aka user study) in human-computer interaction.

		The goal of the tutorial is to gain a new insight into human-product interaction. For that participants will be introduced to a tangible method ‘Tangible interaction frogger’ (TIF) developed by the authors that combines the theory from the ‘interaction frogger’ with a tangible tool. TIF brings teams together to discuss the interaction of products with focus on how actions from users are bridged to functionality in the product through feedback and feed forward as augmented or inherent information.
	</p><p>
		We are five designers/engineers from five different countries (China, Taiwan, Iran, Spain and the Netherlands). Together we are trying to find answers on the question: How to use the TIF to elicit a conversation about human-product interaction? In our work we bridge the gap between design theory and design practice, between designers and non-designers. We make design theory tangible and thereby useable. By working with a tangible model, users of the model can visually and tangibly express their ideas about interaction in human product interaction through moving the sliders of the TIF. Others can see this, change the position of the sliders and in this way discuss about interaction.
