<p>ICS is the premier international forum for the presentation of research results in high-performance computing systems held since 1987.
The focus of ICS is the high performance computers and computation:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Architecture including power-aware, parallel I/O, grid-based, web-based, continuous monitoring,
    self-healing, fault-tolerant, embedded</li>
  <li>Productivity including benchmarks, performance evaluation studies, specialized languages,
    program development tools</font></li>
  <li>Systems including compilers, operating systems, schedulers, runtime optimization </font></li>
  <li>Applications including numeric and non-numeric, scientific, biological, industrial, massive
    sensory processing</li>
  <li>Theoretical underpinnings of any of the above topics as well as analysis and experimental
    evaluation of systems.</li>
</ul>
