Computing education, as a research discipline, is the study of how
people come to understand computational processes and devices, and how
to improve that understanding. As computation becomes ubiquitous in
our world, understanding of computing in order to design, structure,
maintain, and utilize these technologies becomes increasingly
important - both for the technology professional, but also for the
technologically literate citizen. The research study of how the
understanding of computation develops, and how to improve that
understanding, is critically important for the technology-dependent
societies in which we live. 
</p>
<p>
<B>Learning:</B> Computing education is naturally concerned with how
students make sense of computational processes and devices in formal
education, including primary, secondary, and post-secondary
institutions. Computing education also goes beyond formal education.
What do adults understand about computation, and how do they come to
that understanding? What do children understand about computation
given their limited conceptions of time, process, and agency, and how
does that affect their later formal learning about computation? 
</p>
<p>
<b>Instruction:</b> Learning may be enhanced or impeded by
instruction. Educators bring instructional methods, formal or informal
theories, and values to specific learning environments and situations.
As researchers we explore the educators' role in the learning
process?whether that educator is a teacher, near-peer, remote resource
or the computer itself. 
</p>
<p>
Computing Education Research employs methodologies from many fields,
amongst them psychology, education, anthropology and statistics. As a
consequence, research is frequently characterised by a diversity of
methodological approaches; these may be applied directly, or may be
combined and modified to suit the particular cross-disciplinary
questions that we ask.
