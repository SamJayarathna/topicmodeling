<br />
<p><b>Technical Track Paper Submissions</b> (<a href="/contact/?e=program_chair">contact Program Chair</a>)<br />

<ul>
<li>Michael Franz, University of California, Irvine (Program Chair)</li>
<li>John McDermott, Naval Research Lab (Program Co-Chair)</li>
<p />
</ul>
We solicit papers offering novel contributions in any aspect of computer and application security. Papers should present technique or applications with practical experience. Papers are encouraged on technologies and methods that have been demonstrated to be useful for improving information systems security and that address lessons from actual application.
<p />
Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Papers should be at most 15 pages including the bibliography and well-marked appendices and formatted as a single column, using 11-point font and reasonable margins on letter-size paper.  (This format enhances readability for the reviewers.  Accepted papers will be reformatted according to ACM instructions.)  Committee members are not required to read the appendices, and so the paper should be intelligible without them. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized (i.e., papers should not contain author names or affiliations, or obvious citations). Submissions are to be made using the <a href="../openconf/" target="_top">OpenConf</a> system on this site. Only pdf or postscript files will be accepted. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Papers must be received by the deadline above. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference.
<p><a href="papers/" style="padding-left: 20px;">More info</a></p>

<br />

<p><b>Panels</b> (<a href="/contact/?e=panels_chair=">contact Panels Chair</a>)<br />
<ul>
<li>Hongxia Jin, IBM (Panels Chair)</li>
</ul>
Panels are encouraged on the topics listed above. Panels may frame a debate on a controversial question or summarize interesting results, but they must encourage audience participation.  A typical submission will include a proposed moderator, panel members (usually 3-5) and an abstract of the proposed topic.
<p><a href="panels/" style="padding-left: 20px;">More info</a></p>

<br />
<p><b>Case Studies in Applied Security</b> (<a href="/contact/?e=casestudies_chair">contact Case Studies Chair</a>)<br />

<ul>
<li>Steven Rome, Booz Allen Hamilton (Case Studies Chair)</li>
</ul>
   The Case Studies in Applied Security Track is a critical part of the technical
   conference. It is an opportunity for professionals to share
   information that is current without writing a detailed technical
   paper, but enables attendees to learn about the next generation of products and solutions. It is open to anyone in the community such as vendors, network providers, systems integrators, government civil/federal/military programs or users across the spectrum of computer security applications. Potentially this is where attendees can learn about client needs and vendors solutions. This year we are especially interested in automated solutions based on existing knowledge.  While the Case Studies will not be included in the Proceedings, the presentations will be posted to the ACSAC site following the conference.</p>
<p><a href="case-studies/" style="padding-left: 20px;">More info</a></p>

<br />
<p><b>Posters</b> (<a href="/contact/?e=poster_chair">Contact Poster Chair</a>)<br />

<ul>
<li>Benjamin Kuperman, Oberlin College (Posters Chair)</li>
</ul>
The poster session provides an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present their new and innovative preliminary work in an informal, interactive setting.  Conference attendees can learn about novel on-going research projects that might not yet be complete, but whose preliminary results are already interesting.  Poster presenters will have an opportunity to discuss their work and get invaluable feedback from knowledgeable sources at an early stage of their research.
</p>
<p><a href="posters/" style="padding-left: 20px;">More info</a></p>

<br />
<p><b>Tutorials</b> (<a href="/contact/?e=tutorials_chair">contact Tutorials Chair</a>)<br />

<ul>
<li>Daniel Faigin, The Aerospace Corporation, USA. (Tutorials Chair)</li>
</ul>
   Tutorials are full (6 hour) or half (3 hour) day classes on how to
   apply or use a particular technology to address a security need. A
   typical tutorial submission includes an abstract of the tutorial, a
   brief (1-2 page) outline, an instructor bio, an indication of
   length, and notes on prerequisites and textbooks. Tutorial
   instructors receive an honorarium and expenses. If you would like
   to indicate a topic you would like to see, you may do that as well;
   please suggest an instructor if you can. Send your submissions
   to... [tutorials_chair].

<p><b>Workshop</b> (<a href="/contact/?e=workshops_chair">Contact Workshops Chair</a>)<br />

<ul>
<li>Harvey Rubinovitz, The MITRE Corporation (Workshop Chair)</li>
</ul>
   ACSAC workshops are on up to date topics that attendees usually
   rate to provide a useful and exciting forum for information
   technology professionals (e.g., standards developers, software
   developers, security engineers, security officers) to exchange
   ideas, concerns, and opinions.
</p>
<p><a href="workshop/" style="padding-left: 20px;">More info</a></p>

<br />
<p><b>Works In Progress</b> (<a href="/contact/?e=wip_chair">Contact WIP Chair</a>)<br />

<ul>
<li>Charlie Payne, Adventium Labs (WiP Chair)</li>
</ul>
   The Works in Progress (WiP) session offers short presentations (5
minutes maximum) of ongoing work.  These presentations highlight the
most current work in both business and academia, emphasizing goals and
value added, accomplishments to date, and future plans. Special
consideration is given to topics that discuss real life security
experience, including system implementation, deployment, and lessons
learned. Starting in 2010, the presentation can be either slides or
video.

<p><b>Conferenceship Program </b></p>

<p>ACSAC offers a conferenceship program to enable students to attend the
Annual Computer Security Applications Conference. This program will
pay for the conference and tutorial expenses, including travel, for
selected students. Additional information about this program is
available on the <a href="students/">Student Awards page</a>.</p>

<p><hr /></p>
<p><b>Future Updates:</b></p>

<p>To be added to the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference
Mailing List, <a href="/list/">click here</a>.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>ACSAC does not accept "speaking proposals" per se, however; you are encouraged to submit suggestions in the form of a one paragraph description of a topic and a biography of the proposed presenter. Depending on a proposal's
technical content, it may be acceptable as a case study. If a full
paper is available, it may be acceptable as a technical paper. If a
presentation by a group of related speakers is contemplated, a
proposal for this session may be acceptable as a panel or forum. If a
proposal for a half day or full day seminar is appropriate, it may be
acceptable as a tutorial. If a one or two page technical writeup is
available that describes work that is not yet completed, it may be
acceptable as a poster. Finally, if your have an interest
in a full day interactive dialogue, exchanging ideas, opinions and
concerns between multiple presenters and attendees, consider being a
workshop presenter.</p>

<p><b>About the Sponsor</b></p>

<p><a href="/acsa/">Applied Computer Security Associates (ACSA)</a> had its genesis in the
first Aerospace Computer Security Applications Conference in
1985. That conference was a success and evolved into the Annual
Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC). Several years ago
the word "Aerospace" was dropped from the name to promote a wider

range of government and commercial applications. ACSA was incorporated
in 1987 as a non-profit association of computer security professionals
who have a common goal of improving the understanding, theory, and
practice of computer security. ACSA continues to be the primary
sponsor of the annual conference.</p>

<p>In 1989, ACSA began the Distinguished Lecture Series at the annual
conference. Each year, an outstanding computer security professional
is invited to present a lecture of current topical interest to the
security community. In 1991, ACSA began a Best-Paper by a Student
Award, presented at the Annual conference. This award is intended to
encourage active student participation in the annual conference. The
award winning student author receives an honorarium and all expenses
to the conference.</p>

<p>ACSA continues to be committed to serving the security community by
finding additional approaches for encouraging and facilitating
dialogue and technical interchange. ACSA is always interested in
suggestions from interested professionals and computer security
professional organizations on how to achieve these goals.</p>
