             <h1>Workshop Theme and Goals</h1>
               <p><i>Location</i> has become an important concept for many Web-based applications, in particular because of the increasing popularity of mobile Internet access. So far, however, location concepts are reinvented in many different places and these diverging concepts make it hard to use location-based services and data in a truly open way.
<br/> The <i>Second International Workshop on Location and the Web (LocWeb 2009)</i> targets the capabilities and constraints of <i>Web-based location-oriented services</i>, looking at browser-based applications, as well as at native applications using Web services.<br/> The <i>focus</i> of this workshop is on exploring approaches for handling the complexity of location-based services and, more specifically, looking at location abstractions, location sharing, privacy issues, and interface design issues.
<br/></p>
<p>
The<i> goal</i> is to create a starting point for attaining better understanding of how the Web has to change to embrace location as a first-class concept and to bring together key scientists in all participating disciplines in order to stimulate open discussion. It is our hope that we will be able to achieve increased synergy of approaches between the disciplines engaged in Web technologies, HCI, UbiComp, and other related fields. More directly, we intend to encourage immediate interdisciplinary collaboration on future research topics. Young scholars and Ph.D. students are especially encouraged to submit papers and participate in the workshop.
              <br /><br />

The workshop was held on April 4th, 2009 in Boston in conjunction with <a href="http://www.chi2009.org">CHI 2009</a>. To keep the community interested in Location and the Web better connected, we have a LocWeb <a href="http://dret.typepad.com/dretblog/2008/06/locweb-mailing-list.html">mailing list</a> available. </p>
