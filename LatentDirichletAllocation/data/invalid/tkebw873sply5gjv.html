As one grows mainly in the youthful stage, cell division is very active however as aging approaches the cells start to divide slowly as the dermis (inner skin layer) starts to thicken. This interferes with normal skin formation, structure and stretchiness. The skin also starts to lose moisture holding ability, healing ability and the oil content of skin reduces. All these factors contribute to the formation of wrinkles.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Facial muscle contraction is a normal body process that is known to increase the formation and expression of wrinkles on the face. These include activities like frowning, smiling and squinting. Excessive exposure of the skin to direct sunlight is also known to trigger wrinkle formation. Individuals are recommended to wear sunscreen or protective clothing whenever going out door or rather limit outdoor activities to prevent wrinkle formation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Collagen is the key component of the skin structure and formation. Habits like smoking interfere with production of collagen which in turn results to wrinkle formation. This is why it is always recommended for one to cease smoking.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Wrinkle treatment solutions</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are many wrinkle treatment methods that have been proposed and are being used by different people across the globe. Make sure you have a look at various <a href="http://bestwrinklecreamresearch.com/">wrinkle cream reviews</a> online to find out some of the alternatives available for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Wrinkle treatment ranges from traditional methods to modern medical techniques. Traditional techniques mainly involve the use of herbs however there is no conclusive evidence that they get rid of wrinkles completely.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over the counter prescriptions like use of wrinkle creams and lotions are known to be very effective in getting rid of wrinkles. Wrinkle creams basically help to repair and nourish the skin reviving the young and appealing look.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other wrinkle treatments involve scrapping the layers of the skin or dissolving the skin using chemical peels. These are traditional techniques that are still in use in the modern society. Surgery is medical treatment for removing wrinkles. Surgery procedures involve laser treatment that aims at approaching treatment from the deeper layers of the skin. Other treatments involve stimulating the dermis to produce more collagen.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-23" title="wrinkle cream reviews" alt="wrinkle cream reviews" src="http://www.icmr2011.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/16-300x180.jpg" width="300" height="180" />With all being said, use of wrinkle creams remains to be the easiest, effective and safest way of removing wrinkles.

							<p>Thyroid is a small gland found at the base of the neck. Thyroid gland produces hormones that regulate key metabolic processes in the entire body. When the thyroid glands are not able to produce the hormones in sufficient amount then it results to a deficiency known as hypothyroidism. Insufficient amounts of thyroid hormones leads to various body metabolic processes to either slow down or stop.</p>
<p>Thyroid hormone receptors are placed almost everywhere in the entire body. Any disturbance that affects the functioning of thyroid glands will lead to tremendous problems in the body system including the heart, gastro intestinal tract, mood, sleep, nails, skin and hair.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-20" title="http://thyroidsupplementstruth.com/" alt="http://thyroidsupplementstruth.com/" src="http://www.icmr2011.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/15.jpg" width="183" height="275" />Thyroid problems affect anyone regardless of age gender and race. However, old age individuals are more susceptible to thyroid problems especially women. The symptoms of thyroid problems develop gradually and take time to manifest sometimes even years. These symptoms include fatigue, unintentional weight gain, dry, rough or pale skin, hair loss, brittle or dry nails, sensitivity to cold, joint and muscle aches and decreased sex drive among many more.</p>
<p>Iodine deficiency is another cause of thyroid hormone deficiency. Our body requires this and many other nutrients for our body to be healthy and active. It is advisable to stay away from medications that cause deficiency of iodine since it will also sow down thyroid hormone production. Make sure you consult your doctor for alternatives.</p>
<p>There are several things that you can do to boost your thyroid hormone deficiency. Eating healthy that is food rich in iodine as well as balanced diet will help increase thyroid hormone production in the body. Regular exercise is very important since it will help boost your thyroid production to optimum level as well as keep your body fit.</p>
<p>Most importantly is the use of thyroid supplements. Most doctors recommend thyroid supplements to their patients because they know it is safe and effective. Make sure that you take the thyroid supplements as prescribed by the doctor to keep your thyroid working at optimum. There is a lot of information being provided online about Thyroid supplements, some of this information maybe misguiding hence make sure you find resourceful information from the likes of <a href="http://thyroidsupplementstruth.com/" target="_blank">http://thyroidsupplementstruth.com/</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, it has been proven scientifically that thyroid hormone levels in our body have a direct relationship with the vitamins and minerals that we consume in our diet. Therefore make sure that you add enough amounts of vitamins and minerals to your diet.</p>
