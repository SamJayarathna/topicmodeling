<p><b>What is Wrong With Your Knee</b><br />
You will need a knee surgery when the cartilage found in the knee is worn out leaving a painful effect when the bones scrape together. One of the diseases that attack the knee is <a title="arthritis societ" href=" http://www.arthritis.org/" target="_blank">arthritis</a>. Some treatments that are offered include corticosteroid injection, NSAID medications and viscos supplementation. When these fail, surgery remains the only option. When a surgery is done, <a title="recovery" href="http://totalkneereplacementrecovery.net/5-biggest-mistakes-avoid-knee-replacement-recovery/" target="_blank">full knee replacement recovery time</a> might take several months before healing depending on weight, age and general health of the patient. The surgery requires some  changes to be done on the surfaces of the knee. The surgery will take at least two hours to be completed and the duration to stay in the hospital is a minimum of three days to a maximum of seven depending on the condition of the patient.</p>
<p><b>What is a Knee Replacement?</b><br />
The normal knee surfaces are replaced by artificial materials made up of plastics and metals during the surgery. The parts that are fit with these materials include kneecap the femur and the lower part of the bone in the leg. The fixing of the surface is done by using bone cement. The diseased or damaged part of the knee is the only one that is replaced. The condition of ligaments will determine whether they will all be removed or not.</p>
<p><b>Surgery</b><br />
It is during the surgery that a surgeon will correct the defect that caused <a title="knock knees" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genu_valgum" target="_blank">knocked knees</a>  or <a title="bow legs" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genu_varum" target="_blank">bowleggedness</a> and will also remove all the bone spurs found in the knee. You will need to be under anesthesia to reduce pain and sometime epidural, nerve or spine block are in addition used. The doctor talks you through the kind of knee replacement that will suit your condition.<br />
<a title="rehabilitation after a knee replacement" href="http://totalkneereplacementrecovery.net " target="_blank">Rehabilitation after a knee replacement</a> starts immediately following the surgery. During that time that you will remain in the hospital, you would learn how to walk down the stairs with the help of a cane, bend the leg to an angle of 90 degrees and also how to stretch your leg. The pace at which you walk will be monitored to avoid causing damage to your operated leg. This is the best physiotherapy that you can give your leg. The recovery does not stop after surgery; it goes way beyond a full year.</p>
<p><b>How You Know That You Require a Knee Replacement Surgery? </b><br />
There are guidelines that will help you to know whether you need the surgery or not. If the medication given is not working, then you should opt for surgery. Your doctor will prescribe anti-inflammatory medicines like naproxen sodium or ibuprofen to reduce inflammation and pain. These drugs are meant to reduce the pain a patient feels, but they do not treat the knee condition. It is not advisable to take drugs for a life time because they will cause damage to your body. You also need to seek surgery if your physiotherapy is not working. When you feel that you’re unable to handle your daily activities due to knee pain surgery is the next option. Athletes also opt for surgery in order to continue with their sports. You need to make a well-informed choice before you go for the surgery.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ecsa2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/smoker.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-21" src="http://www.ecsa2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/smoker-300x198.jpg" alt="smoker" width="300" height="198" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Electronic cigarettes are new to many people. It is also a popular product although it has not fully penetrated the markets in many countries. The electronic cigarette has existed for about three years and this is a device that encourages smokers to smoke without fire. It is a healthy way compared to smoking a real cigarette. Electronic cigarette helps a person <a title="quit smoking" href=" http://www.cancer.org/healthy/stayawayfromtobacco/guidetoquittingsmoking/" target="_blank">quit smoking</a> and also regulate the rate at which a person smokes.</p>
<p><b>Environment Friendly</b><br />
Electronic cigarette is a much friendly way for a person to use substances like nicotine. A good percentage of smokers has embraced e cigarette because it also does not restrict a person to smoke in a specific area. The e cigarette has a length of 100mm thereby appearing like a real cigarette.</p>
<p>An electronic cigarette contains nicotine that is inhaled by a person. It does not have any taste of tobacco and therefore provides the satisfaction that an individual looks for in substances. Could this be one way that would help a smoker <a title="quit smoking" href=" http://myecigarettecity.com/" target="_blank">quit smoking</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Parts of an E Cigarette</strong></p>
<p>An electronic cigarette has three constituents. They include an atomizer, a battery and a nicotine chamber. The battery is used to produce energy that is required to evaporate a liquid solution that is inhaled by the user. An electronic cigarette is started by power that is produced by the battery attached.</p>
<p>A renewable nicotine chamber helps a person to smoke an e cigarette just like they would smoke a normal cigarette. The chamber allows the vapor to flow out like a usual cigarette and also glow at the end of the chamber.</p>
<p>There is also nicotine cartridge that permits the user to regulate the amount of nicotine vapor that is inhaled and thus helps them to quit smoking. This cartridge equals 20 cigarettes. In other words, it’s like smoking 20 cigarettes in one cartridge. This saves the smoker a lot of money if you’re to compare what they would spend to buy the cigarette. The level of nicotine could be low medium and standard.</p>
<p><strong>Can Smoke in Public</strong></p>
<p><a title="e smoking" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette" target="_blank">Electronic smoking</a> is not restricted to the public areas. This is because it does not emit any smoke and harmful substances that would affect those people who are living with a smoker; thus, it is a healthier option. It is stressful when a smoker needs a puff and cannot smoke in public.  A smoker can be allowed to use an electronic cigarette in offices, restaurants and even pubs. He does not have to stop his work to take some time in smoking zones</p>
<p>An electronic cigarette makes an environment sociable. If compared to traditional cigarettes, e cigarettes are cheap, environmental friendly and healthier. One of the cheapest e cig  brands available is the <a title="metro e cigs" href=" http://myecigarettecity.com/e-cigarette-brands/metro-e-cigs/" target="_blank">metro ecigarette</a> A more expensive brand is the <a title="smokeless selects" href="http://myecigarettecity.com/e-cigarette-review/eversmoke-e-cig-review/" target="_blank">smokeless selects</a> brand  These cigarettes are gaining momentum marketwise; and with time, they will replace the harmful and dangerous substances that are consumed in cigarettes.</p>

<p>Do you like keeping a cat as your pet? In order to ensure your cat is living happily and <a title="health of cats " href="http://pets.webmd.com/cats/" target="_blank">healthy</a>, you have to follow some tips given below. For those of you who keep a pet, you can tell that it’s not an easy thing to do. On the other hand, it is not difficult to keep a<a title="cat" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" target="_blank"> cat</a> in your house feeling healthy and happy. You need to check that your cat gets the following:</p>
<p><b>Food</b></p>
<p>You need to feed your cat with high quality food. Cat’s digestive system is not the same as that one for a human being. You do not have to feed your cat with human leftovers or scraps. Cats also need to eat fresh food and thus leftovers are not good for them. You might think that those foods are okay while in the real sense they are spoilt. This will upset your cat’s stomach or even make her fall sick.</p>
<p><b>Get to know your pet</b></p>
<p>All cats are not the same. They may also <a title="cat behavior" href="http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/cat-behavior" target="_blank">behave differently</a>. Make sure that you are familiar with your cat such that you can tell when things are not alright with it. You can call in for a <a title="vet in mckinney, tx" href="http://mckinneyvet.org" target="_blank">vet in mckinney, Tx </a>whenever you see that your cat is not looking as usual.</p>
<p><b>Litter boxes</b></p>
<p>Ensure that you put a litter box empty to avoid the waste smelling. Cats are sensitive to things that stink and thus they will not be comfortable in your house. Empty boxes will also provide a fresh smell in the house. You can also train your cat to use the boxes to relieve itself. Cats can internalize discipline very quickly; and if trained well, they can learn how to use the boxes to dispose their waste. Thus, it is really important for you to dispose off the waste bins.</p>
<p><b>Vaccinations</b></p>
<p>Vaccination is always good for your cat as it is to you. This will prevent your cat from acquiring diseases that may end up killing it. Vaccines will provide immune in the body of the cat such that in cases of any outbreak, your cat will be safe. Curing your cat may be more expensive than preventing some illnesses. It will be important to put aside a budget that will cater for the vaccine expenses and be sure to discuss the proper vaccines with your <a title="mckinney vet" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYyIlObjS6w" target="_blank">mckinney vet</a>.</p>
<p><b>Spend time with your cat</b></p>
<p>Cats are very fond of humans. They also need human love and affection like any person would. Ensure that you show your cat affection by holding and giving it some massage on the head ears and the tail. You should also take your time to play with your cat on daily basis. If time may not be available for such plays, then you should find some minutes to pamper it. Cats take a human character of being jealous. If you do not find time for your cat, it might get depressed.</p>
