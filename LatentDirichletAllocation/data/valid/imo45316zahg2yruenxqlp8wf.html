NOSSDAV 2012, the 22nd SIGMM Workshop on Network and  Operating Systems Support for Digital Audio and Video, will be held in Toronto, Canada, on June 7-8 2012. As in previous years, the workshop will continue to focus on both established and emerging research topics, high-risk high-return ideas and proposals, and future  research directions in multimedia networking and systems, in a single-track format that encourages active participation and discussions among academic and industry researchers and practitioners.
</p>
<p>
The workshop seeks research papers in all areas of multimedia networking and systems. Authors are especially encouraged to submit papers with real-world experimental results and real data sets. Topics of interest include (but are not restricted to):

<ul>
<li>Operating system, middleware and network support
<li>cloud and peer-to-peer system architectures
<li>Media streaming, distribution and storage support
<li>Web 2.0 systems and social networks
<li>Wireless networks and embedded systems for multimedia applications
<li>Multi-core and many-core architecture support
<li>Networked GPUs, graphics and virtual environments
<li>Networked games / Real-time immersive systems
<li>Multimedia communications and system security
</ul>

<p>In particular, we are interested in soliciting papers that discuss system-level support for social media and social networking, papers that focus on improving performance with multi-core and many-core processors, as well as papers that focus on multimedia applications on mobile devices and/or in a cloud computing environment.</p>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="cfp.html">Call for Papers</a> for more details about paper submissions.</p>
