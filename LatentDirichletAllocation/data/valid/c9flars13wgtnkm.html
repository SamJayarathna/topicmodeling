<h2>Papers and Speakers</h2>

<p>
We have a very exicting program for PASTE!  Here is the list of
</p>

<h3><a href="schedule.html">Schedule of Talks</a></h3>

<p>
Note that we have ample time for <strong>demos</strong>, and welcome
all attendees, not only authors of accepted papers, to demonstrate
their tools.  We also have time for <strong>5 minute madness</strong>:
anyone in the audience is welcome to take up to five minutes to tell
the audience about their work (again, not just authors of accepted
papers).
</p>

<p>
We also have two outstanding keynote speakers:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~bultan/">Tevfik Bultan</a>, UCSB,
  speaking about
  <a href="bultan.html"><strong>Modularity, 
    Interfaces and Verification</strong></a></li>

<li><a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jha/">Somesh Jha</a>, Wisconsin,
  speaking about
  <a href="jha.html"><strong>Retrofitting Legacy Code
    for Security</strong></a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
PASTE is a high-powered workshop that <a href="past.html">meets
roughly every 18 months</a>, alternating between programming language
and software engineering venues and intending to serve as a bridge
between the two.  This is the eighth workshop in the series.  The
venue brings together the program analysis, software tools, and
software engineering communities to focus on applications of program
analysis techniques in software tools.  It's high-powered because the
content is generally novel, interesting, and provocative; but by
virtue of being a workshop, we have the freedom to experiment with the
format, and PASTE frequently does.
</p>

<p>
This year
PASTE will take place in Atlanta, GA, USA,
co-located with
<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/conferences/fse16/">ACM
SIGSOFT Foundations of Software Engineering</a>.
</p>

<h2>Topics of Interest</h2>

<p>
PASTE 2008 will provide a forum for the presentation of exciting
research, empirical results, and new directions in areas including
(but not limited to):
</p>

<ul>
<li>program analysis for program understanding, debugging, testing, and
   reverse engineering</li>
<li>integration of program analysis into programming environments</li>
<li>user interfaces for software tools and software visualization</li>
<li>applications of program slicing, model checking, and other program
   analysis techniques</li>
<li>analysis of program execution or program evolution</li>
<li>integration of, or tradeoffs between, different analysis techniques</li>
<li>issues in scaling analyses and user interfaces to deal with 
  large systems</li>
</ul>

<p>
PASTE will be a true workshop, with research presentations, organized
discussions, opportunities for all attendees to paricipate, and ample
time for debate.
</p>

<h2>Important Submission Guidelines</h2>

<p>
Papers must be submitted in PDF format and printable on US Letter size
paper. Papers submitted to PASTE must be original work, must not
substantially duplicate previous work, and must not be under
simultaneous review elsewhere.  Violation of any of these criteria
will be sufficient grounds for automatic rejection.  Please adhere
to the re-publication policies of
<a href="http://www.acm.org/pubs/sim_submissions.html">ACM</a>
and
<a href="http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm">SIGPLAN</a>.
At least one author of every accepted paper must register and attend
the event to present their work.
</p>

<h2>Submission Categories</h2>

<p>
PASTE will have both short (3-page) and long (6-page) papers in
the
<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">ACM</a>
paper format (you can use the alternate style if you wish).
The program committee will select papers based on technical quality,
relevance to the PASTE community, and ability to inspire new research.
</p>

<p>
These page limits <em>exclude</em> the formal bibliography.
<em>Everything</em> else&mdash;appendices, related work discussion,
etc.&mdash;must fit within the page limit for your chosen length, but
the actual bibliography (list of citations) can take up as much
additional length as you wish (though in practice we would be shocked
if you took up more than one more page...).  We assume these
instructions are clear enough but, if you are in doubt, you are
welcome to seek clarification from the chairs.  Papers that flout
these limits will be summarily rejected.
</p>

<p>
For either length, a paper can be either a regular submission (the
default) or be designated an RFF, a new category described below.
</p>

<h4>Requests for Feedback (RFF)</h4>

<p>
PASTE serves two goals.  To some it is a peer-reviewed conference
whose papers appear in the ACM Digital Library for archival purposes.
For others it is a high-quality workshop with plenty of opportunity to
get feedback on work that is in progress.  We want to support both
constituencies.
</p>

<p>
By default, PASTE papers will be treated as formal submissions, be
judged on technical merit, and accepted papers will be published by
the ACM to appear in the Digital Library.  However, authors who only
want to get feedback&mdash;and retain the right to submit the same
material to another venue later&mdash;can instead submit a paper as a
<em>Request for Feedback</em> (RFF).  An RFF is expressly not a
&ldquo;publication&rdquo;; it should be viewed only as a request for
time to present at the workshop and obtain feedback.  The PC will
judge RFFs primarily for their presentability, not their technical
merits, so authors are expected to not list RFFs as formal
publications.
</p>

<p>
We did consider making all short publications automatically be RFFs,
and all full publications regular submissions.  We decided against
this for two reasons.  First, it is indeed possible to have an
archivable result expressed in very few pages (as some classic papers
prove), and we want to encourage such brevity.  Second, the decision
of whether the submission should result in an archival publication
should rest with the authors.
</p>

<p>
All RFF papers must bear the prefix &ldquo;Request For
Feedback:&rdquo; in their title, and <em>must</em> retain this title
in the final versions.
