<p>We are pleased to present the thirty-first SIGCSE Technical Symposium
in Computer Science Education.&nbsp; This is an event in which people involved
in computing education, of all flavors and at all levels, share ideas and
problems, gain new insights and inspiration, and, most importantly, reenergize
each other.&nbsp; We are interested in content and in methodologies, in
learning new ways to do things and learning how to know when our old and
new ways are really effective.&nbsp; We are about research and experience.&nbsp;
If you care about teaching computing, there is something for you in this
meeting.&nbsp; Join with about 900 others with similar priorities and have
a great time in Austin, Texas in the first Spring of the new millenium.
<p>Look for the many ways to participate in this symposium.&nbsp; <b><i>Papers,
posters, workshops, birds of a feather, seminars and more</i></b> provide
many opportunities for active involvement.&nbsp; Watch your students's
work for candidates for the <b><i>ACM Student Research Competition.</i></b>&nbsp;
A conference presentation may be the spark that leads to a career in research
and/or teaching computing.&nbsp; Spread the word about the <b><i>Doctoral
Consortium</i></b>, a day before the Symposium begins when Ph.D. candidates
with particular interest in Computer Science Education have their own meeting.&nbsp;
Nominate your favorite candidate for one of the <b><i>SIGCSE Awards</i></b>:
The outstanding contributions to Computer Science Education and the Lifetime
Service awards.&nbsp; Send nominations to Margaret Reek, SIGCSE Vice Chair
and <a href="mailto://mmr@cs.rit.edu">Chair of the Awards Committee</a>.&nbsp;
Awardees enter very <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigcse/awards/">distinguished
company</a> and the SIGCSE awards are regarded as high honors.
<p>This web site will evolve as time passes and the program becomes set.&nbsp;
Come back often to see what is happening.&nbsp; If something that you need
is missing, let us know.&nbsp; Meanwhile, start planning for the gathering
in Austin.&nbsp; See you there!
