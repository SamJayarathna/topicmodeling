      <p> The 2006 Conference on Human-Robot Interaction is the
inaugural event in an annual conference dedicated to human and robot
interaction (HRI). During the last several years, HRI researchers have
been holding meetings in tracks of other more general conferences.
However, because the HRI community has increased in size and because
the techniques of this emerging discipline are varied, it is now
important to provide a dedicated venue that allows HRI researchers to
interact with and to receive high quality reviews from fellow
specialists. The theme of HRI 06, <b>Robots effectively serving humans</b>,
highlights the importance of creating robot capabilities and interfaces
that address human concerns such as social appropriateness, safety, and
quality of service. This inaugural annual event will be held in March
2006 in Salt Lake City during the beautiful spring ski season. </p>

<h2>Who Should Attend</h2>
<p>
Researchers in robotics, human-factors, ergonomics, and human-computer
interaction are invited to attend. Because human-robot interaction is
inherently inter-disciplinary, the conference is seeking papers from
several disciplines. A primary goal of the conference is to create a
common venue for a broad set of researchers. By appealing to a broad
set of researchers, the conference complements many existing venues.<br>
<br>
The conference will provide high quality reviews to full papers and
will allow presentation of emerging research through a poster session.
