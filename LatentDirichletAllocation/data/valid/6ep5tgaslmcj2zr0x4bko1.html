<h1>Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security</h1>


<p>The
    seventh Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) will
    be held
July 20-22, 2011 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. This
symposium will bring together an interdisciplinary group of
researchers and practitioners in human computer interaction, security,
and privacy. The program features technical papers, workshops and tutorials, a
poster session, panels and invited talks, and discussion
    sessions. SOUPS 2011 will be held in cooperation with ACM
    SIGCHI.</p>

  <p>SOUPS 2011 will be held on the Carnegie Mellon University
  campus.<!--  <a href = "venue.html">Accommodations</a> have been
  reserved for SOUPS attendees at a nearby hotel. --></p> 

<!-- <p>SOUPS 2010 will be co-located with the <a href =
  "http://www.ceas.cc/">Collaboration, Electronic messaging,
  Anti-Abuse and Spam Conference</a> (CEAS 2010), which will be held
  on July 13 and 14.</p> -->

<!--
<h3>SOUPS 2011 Highlights</h3>

<p>During this three-day event, you'll have an opportunity to hear
  from people doing cutting edge research as well as from industry
  folks who will report on their first hand experiences with usable
  privacy and security challenges. The popular SOUPS poster session
  as well as social events, breaks, and discussion sessions will provide opportunities to
  share ideas and network with other participants.<p>

<p>The SOUPS 2011 <a href = "program.html#invited">invited talk</a>
will be given by ?? Our panel this year will examine
 ??</p>

<p>Continuing the tradition of interesting SOUPS social events, on Wednesday
  evening SOUPS 2009 attendees will head to the
  <a href = "http://www.computerhistory.org/">
Computer History Museum</a> for dinner.</p>
  -->

<h3>Not Your Typical Conference</h3>

<p>SOUPS distinguishes itself from other
  conferences by both providing a high quality technical program and
  by bringing together an interdisciplinary group of
  attendees in a format conducive to informal discussion and
  networking. SOUPS offers  reasonable registration fees, which
  include meals catered by local restaurants featuring a variety of
  cuisines. Past attendees have raved about "the amazing group of
  people who were here to talk with" and the "awesome food."
One past attendee wrote: <b>"Overall, this is the best conference I've attended. I may be ruined
forever going to SIGCHI and other larger conferences."</b></p>


<!--
  <p>The first formal gathering of researchers actively working in
  this interdisciplinary area took place at the <a href =
  "http://www.andrewpatrick.ca/CHI2003/HCISEC/">CHI 2003 Workshop on
  Human-Computer Interaction and Security Systems</a>. A larger <a
  href = "http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Workshops/Tools/">Workshop on
  Usable Privacy and Security Software (WUPSS)</a> was held at the
  DIMACS Center at Rutgers in July 2004. WUPSS participants expressed
  a desire for an event that would combine a refereed papers track
  with less formal research discussions. In July 2005 the <a href = "../2005/">first SOUPS
  conference</a> took place in Pittsburgh, PA. It was followed by a
  <a href = "../2006/">second SOUPS conference</a> in July 2006.</p>

<p><b>Call for SOUPS Lightning Talks: Emerging Issues in Usable Privacy
and Security</b><br> This year, SOUPS 2011 will feature a Lightning Talks
interactive session with the goal of increasing interactions between
researchers and practitioners. We hope that the session will result in
motivating scenarios for academic research and promote future
collaborations between researchers and practitioners. A lightning talk
is a 5-minute slot where participants stand up and speak about
anything related to emerging issues in usable privacy and
security. These could include emerging hot topics, practical problems
encountered by end users or industry practitioners, a lesson learned,
a research challenge that could benefit from feedback, a war story,
ongoing research, a success, a failure, a future experiment, tips and
tricks, a pitfall to avoid, etc. 
If you would like to participate in the lightning talk session, please
email sessions@cups.cs.cmu.edu by July 15, with your name,
affiliation, the tentative title, and a brief abstract (up to 200
words) of your lightning talk. Confirmations of a lightning talk slot
will be given by July 11th. You will need to deliver your slides for
the 5 minute talk to the Interactive Sessions Chair via the same email
address by Monday, July 18.</p>
