<b>Title: What Should a College Classroom Look Like in a Digital Age? <a href="wccce11-carlisle.pdf">Presentation slides</a></b><br/>
<i>Supported by ACM SIGCSE Speaker's Fund</i><br/><br/>
<b>Abstract:</b><br/>
The internet has made available to students a huge range of resources
that can be accessed without ever leaving home.  Courses can be taken
online, and some universities have even made all of their lectures
available for free download.  What then should the role of a college
professor be?  Do we continue with the traditional lecture?  If so,
why is an experience in our classrooms more valuable than an online
course or a downloaded lecture?  Do we believe our lectures are more
scintillating than others?  Perhaps instead we should abandon the
lecture and use a constructivist approach where we simply guide
students in their exploration.  Or is the best approach a balance of
the two?  We'll discuss techniques for having a more dynamic
classroom, where students are more prepared and more engaged.  Most
importantly, there is evidence that these techniques yield greater
learning!

Martin C. Carlisle, Ph.D., is a professor of computer science at the
United States Air Force Academy.  He has a Bachelor of Science in
mathematics and computer science from the University of Delaware, and
a Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy in computer science from
Princeton University.  He has made numerous contributions to the
computer science education community, and is most well known for
RAPTOR, an introductory programming environment using flowcharts, and
his YouTube videos introducing Java.  He has been named an ACM
Distinguished Educator, the CASE Colorado Professor of the Year and
the US Air Force Academy Outstanding Science and Engineering Educator
and was awarded the US Air Force Exemplary Civilian Service Award.

<b>2. Morning of May 7</b><br/><br/>
<b>Title: Expanding the Frontiers of Computer Science Education <a href="wccce11-sahami.pdf">Presentation slides</a></b><br/><br/>
<b>Abstract:</b><br/>
It is well known that there have been large swings in Computer Science
enrollments in the last two decades.  Many factors have been cited for these
enrollment changes, including changes in the economy in the high-tech sector
and the general image of computing.  In this talk, we begin by examining
some of the factors affecting enrollments in CS, analyzing both historical
and current trends.  In light of this analysis, we then turn our attention
to significant changes made in Stanford's undergraduate CS program, which
aim to expand the scope of education in computer science and highlight the
diversity of options available in the field.  We discuss the results of
these changes--a near doubling in undergraduate CS enrollments in just two
years--and analyze some of the reasons why.  We finally look at CS
curriculum development at the international level, discussing the effort to
define a new ACM/IEEE-CS Computing Curricula volume on Computer Science by
the year 2013, known as CS2013. <br/><br/>

<b>Short bio:</b><br/>
Mehran Sahami is an Associate Professor and Associate Chair for Education in
the Computer Science department at Stanford University.  Prior to joining
the Stanford faculty, he was a Senior Research Scientist at Google for
several years.  His research interests include computer science education,
machine learning, and information retrieval on the Web.  His work in the
Computer Science Education community includes creating and serving as
founding chair for the annual Symposium on Educational Advances in
Artificial Intelligence (EAAI) as well as serving as co-chair of the
ACM/IEEE-CS joint task force on Computing Curricula: Computer Science 2013.
He recently spearheaded the redesign of Stanford's undergraduate CS
curriculum, which led to a significant increase in the number of students
pursuing CS as a major.  Additionally, he has published over 40 technical
papers and has over 20 patent filings on a variety of topics including web
search, recommendation engines in social networks, and email spam filtering
that have been deployed in commercial applications.  He received his BS, MS,
and Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University.
