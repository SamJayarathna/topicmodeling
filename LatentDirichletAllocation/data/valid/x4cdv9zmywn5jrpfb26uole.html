A Very Successful Workshop! The work is just beginning!</H2>


<P>
"Performance failure is the number one cause of software project
failure", 
according to one participant, and the workshop addressed how to get
performance under the control of the software developers. Discussion
was 
enthusiastic and organized and led to a program of work towards
a successor workshop next year. The 83 participants included a balance
from
industry and universities, from software engineering and performance,
and an
international mix from North Americal and Europe. They
discussed how to capture performance requirements correctly
(NOT "goes like the wind") and track them throughout the project, and
the
problems of integrating performance methodology into software
engineering, of 
developing the practice, and of defining the research priorities,

Despite its acknowledged importance this area has seen slow progress,
because of the different cultures in software and in performance, the 
lack of recognized practices, and the immaturity of tools. The
workshop
encouraged all those present to hope that this group can now succeed.
Working groups were set up to develop plans, approaches 
and data on many different topics, for next year's meeting; more
details 
will be found at the conference web site www.sce.carleton.ca/wosp98. 
Full reports on the discussions are being prepared. The proceedings
are
available from ACM (order number 488983).
