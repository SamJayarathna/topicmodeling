PPDP 2001 follows on from previous conferences held in Paris in 1999
and Montreal in 2000.

Here is the <A HREF = "ppdp2001.cfp.html">Call for Papers</A> for this
year's conference.
<p>
PPDP 2001 aims to stimulate research on the use of declarative methods
in programming and on the design, implementation and application of
programming languages that support such methods.  Topics of interest
include any aspect related to understanding, integrating and extending
programming paradigms such as those for functional, logic, constraint
and object-oriented programming; concurrent extensions and mobile
computing; type theory; support for modularity; use of logical methods
in the design of program development tools; program analysis and
verification; abstract interpretation; development of implementation
methods; application of the relevant paradigms and associated methods
in industry and education.  
<p>
The technical 
<a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/ppdp01/program.html">program</a>
of the conference includes invited talks by
