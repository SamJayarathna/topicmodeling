<p>
The International Conference on Electronic Commerce (ICEC) annually brings
together the leaders of the scientific research community in e-commerce and
e-business from all over the world.  
This conference marks the second time that the conference will be held 
in the United States, having most recently been held in Xi'an, China 
and in <a href="http://icec06.net/">Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada</a>.  
<p>
ICEC'07 will
feature: invited keynote presentations; panels on topical issues on 
technology, business and public policy; refereed paper presentations 
on emerging and continuing research
issues; and tutorials and workshops that are designed to identify new
areas for knowledge development and sharing.  With involvement from the IT
industry and the business community, ICEC'07 will encourage new dialogues and
exchanges that will enable each side to take advantage of what the other 
has to offer in terms of technological, managerial and public policy know how.
<p>
The conference will showcase new ideas that have emerged from
cross-disciplinary
discovery and collaboration - directions that are at the heart of
current efforts to further advance e-commerce as both a business 
and academic discipline.  The conference theme of ICEC'07 will 
focus on the discovery of innovative techniques and technologies that 
strive to identify and overcome such
difficulties, and set the foundation for new research endeavours that 
will allow e-commerce to grow much more rapidly in the years to come. 
ICEC'07 will have multiple scientific tracks, each chaired by research 
leaders.
