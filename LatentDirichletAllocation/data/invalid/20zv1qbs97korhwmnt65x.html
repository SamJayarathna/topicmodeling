				<p><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/file9611291129825.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-121" alt="fame" src="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/file9611291129825-214x300.jpg" width="214" height="300" /></a>Are you sick and tired of working a dreary 9 to 5 job? Do you dream of seeing your name in lights and having paparazzi snapping your every move?</p>
<p>If you want to become famous in the shortest amount of time possible, then the following information should spark some ideas.</p>
<p>Here are 5 ways you can become famous:</p>
<p><strong>Become a singer</strong></p>
<p>Do you have a decent voice? Then you should try your hand at becoming a singer. Write some songs, record them on your laptop, polish them up with an Audio Editor and then share your songs on sites such as Twitter, YouTube, and Twitter. If you create a buzz then major record companies will soon start to take notice.</p>
<p><strong>Reality TV shows</strong></p>
<p>When your talents are limited, then reality TV may be an option as a path to becoming famous. Shows such as Xfactor, Pop Idol, and Big Brother are always looking for new people, so make sure you apply right away. You could be next.</p>
<p><strong>Marry a celebrity</strong></p>
<p>Quite possibly the fastest way to become famous is by marrying a celebrity. Obviously, a celebrity is not going to come knocking on your door or be seen having a pint at your local pub, which is why you need to get out there and start hanging out at the places where celebrities congregate.</p>
<p>This will typically involve moving to a major city such as Los Angeles or New York, and then visiting high-end restaurants, bars, and nightclubs on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Write a book</strong></p>
<p>Only a few years ago, becoming a published author was extremely tough. You had to get a book deal with a major publisher, and even that wasn&#8217;t any guarantee of success.</p>
<p>How times have changed! Thanks to the internet and sites such as Amazon, you can now write a book, get it published, and have people reading it all over the word. With a bit of buzz or controversy, your book can quickly go viral, and in no time at all you could become an established author.</p>
<p><strong>Become a YouTube sensation</strong></p>
<p>As you are no doubt aware, the video website YouTube gets millions of visitors every single day. If you like the idea of becoming a YouTube sensation, literally overnight, then fame can finally be yours for many years to come. The best way to grab attention with your videos is to do something wacky or off the wall. Look around for inspiration and then start making videos.</p>

			<span class="postinfo">
				<span class="line"></span>
				Posted  by <a href="http://www.mum2010.org/author/admin/" title="Posts by admin" rel="author">admin</a> in <a href="http://www.mum2010.org/category/games/" title="View all posts in Games" rel="category tag">Games</a>				<span class="line"></span>
			</span>
					</div>
				<p><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gta.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-118" alt="gta" src="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gta.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a>In the words of Tony Montana, “first you get the money, then you get the power.” If you have ambitions of becoming a criminal overlord in the world of GTA V, then you would do very well to remember that quote.</p>
<p>So how do you get the money? Here are 7 essential income streams for GTA V players&#8230;</p>
<p>Stock market</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.gta5cheats.com/stock-market-tips/">GTA Stock Market</a> is a great way to make some fast cash. Simply invest in a stock, watch it rise, then cash out. Be careful though, as investing in the wrong stock could mean bankruptcy. Ouch!</p>
<p>Real Estate</p>
<p>Never underestimate the power of buying real estate in GTA V. Sure, those weekly checks from tenants might not seem like a lot at first, but once you start to increase your real estate empire, then those checks quickly start to add up.</p>
<p>Rob stores</p>
<p>Another essential income stream for GTA V players is to rob stores. At the end of the day, some stores on the outskirts of the city are wide open and just screaming to get robbed. If you can be in and out quickly, then robbing stores will prove to be very profitable.</p>
<p>Steal cars</p>
<p>Here is a simple formula for increasing your income in GTA V. Steal cars, repaint them, and then sell for a profit. Don&#8217;t just choose any old cars though, as the more expensive makes and models will bring you a much higher price.</p>
<p>Pick up a bounty</p>
<p>There are many people in GTA V that have a bounty on their head. If you have the skills, and fancy yourself as a silent assassin, then being a contract killer is a very profitable income stream. The best type of weapon to use for these kind of machines is a silencer gun, so you don&#8217;t draw unwanted attention while doing the hit.</p>
<p>Replay missions</p>
<p>Some missions offer a nice wad of cash at the end, which is why you should look to replay the most lucrative missions with different characters. You won&#8217;t be able to do this with every mission, but many side missions allow you to come back time and time again with different characters.</p>
<p>Become the king of heists</p>
<p>One of the hardest things to pull off in GTA V is a successful heist. There are just too many moving parts, and every member of your crew wants their cut which only serves to drive your profit margin lower. However, if you get it right, then a heist will bring a flood of money to your bank account literally overnight.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/file000459357359.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-114" alt="grafitti" src="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/file000459357359-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>Hammond, Indiana can be a tough neighborhood. It’s not easy being a suburb of Chicago, and it’s not a pleasant thing to think about but the crime rate can be a bit higher than most people would like to think about. Lucky for you, there are things you can do to make your home safer, but your best bet would be to have a home security system installed to give you some peace of mind. Just remember, don’t try to cut corners when it comes to home security alarms, as this can turn out to be a real false economy if your homemade security solution ends up failing and you end up having to live with the loss of your valuables!</p>
<p><b>Do It Yourself and Suffer the Consequences</b></p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with trying a do-it-yourself option if you’re looking to invest in a home security system. There are infrared motion detectors and door and window sensors on sale over the internet, and you can even add in wireless cameras and motion-activated floodlights, but you’re going to be missing out on one very important feature: DIY kits don’t come with the option of 24 hour monitoring. Not only that, but all the cash you spend on this security equipment – and all the time and energy you expend – could be cut in half by simply having a skilled an experienced security technician come out to your home to do the installation for you, and there are so many highly qualified technicians in the Hammond area that you’ll find one for you easily.</p>
<p><b> Local Boys Done Good</b></p>
<p>It’s tempting to pass over big home security companies and go with a local outfit because you want to make sure the money you spend ends up in the wallets of local boys, but you really don’t have much to worry about. Not only are <a href="http://experthomealarms.com/adt-alarms/Indiana/Hammond/">Hammond, Indiana ADT</a> technicians just as skilled and experienced as any other company out there that specializes in installing and monitoring home security systems, there’s no reason to pass them over in favor of a company that has a more direct impact on the Hammond economy by being local. That’s because there are ADT authorized dealers across the country, and Hammond is no exception to the rule. The ADT technicians that install your system are local folks, working and living nearby and contributing to the economic health of the region by spending their hard-earned cash in local stores and restaurants, just like you.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MP900302922.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-111" alt="see, hear and speak no evil" src="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MP900302922-300x214.jpg" width="300" height="214" /></a>The humble price comparison website sometimes gets a bad reputation from the financial services industry. Insurers, banks, and other purveyors of financial products and services often rebel against the rise of the comparison website, and there are several providers who actually refuse to associate with any of the aggregator services out of a sense of pride or out of a determination not to contribute to their success, but why do service providers have such disdain for the price comparison industry? Here are some reasons.</p>
<p><b>It Keeps Prices Down and Prevents Competition</b></p>
<p>There are several different subsectors when it comes to the provision of financial products and services, but most of these providers operate using the same general marketing tactics and strategies. New customers are almost always preferable to older existing ones in the world of financial service providers, so the best deals are always held out to anyone looking to switch from their existing provider to a new one. One of the reasons behind this is that the advent of the price comparison website has injected much higher levels of competition into the financial product environment than in years past; while it doesn’t always work perfectly, a price comparison website can keep prices low because how many different quotes, drawn from a large number of companies, it can furnish to a prospective customer.</p>
<p><b>It’s Not Foolproof, but It’s Better Than Nothing</b></p>
<p>If you <a href="http://www.uklandlordinsurance.com/">compare landlord insurance deals on UK Landlord Insurance.com</a>, you’ll easily see that there can be a very wide variation in the range of insurance cover you can get for roughly the same price. You will see that many insurers will offer landlord insurance packages that only feature a few core pieces of cover, while others will be more exhaustive and provide much higher levels of cover to protect a landlord from any eventuality. These more all-encompassing policies may have higher premium prices, but not always; sometimes you might even find an insurer offering a policy with relatively low cover at a price that is higher than one of its competitors that’s offering more for less! This goes true for almost every financial service provider, whether it be life insurance and car insurance, bank accounts and savings bonds, or business loans and mortgages.</p>
<p><b>It Exposes Poor Business Practice</b></p>
<p>The bare fact of the matter is that when a price comparison website feeds a customer several price quotes and one is far-and-above the worst choice by offering the least amount of cover for the highest price, the service provider behind the quote ends up with a proverbial black eye. Comparison sites expose firms that offer poor value for money, and ironically companies that have been exposed in such a way often blame the comparison site for their bad publicity instead of turning their gaze inward to where the true problem lies.</p>

However, this doesn’t have to be the case – there are many ways to find lower-cost <a href="http://ejewelrydeals.com/">jewelry deals</a> that can see you stepping out with a striking piece on your neck, finger or wrist and not leave you without enough money for anything else.</p>
<p><b>It Doesn’t Have to Fall Off the Back of a Truck</b></p>
<p>Jewelry is a form of moveable wealth that is easily transported, holds its value quite well, and has been popular as an adornment for quite literally thousands of years. Not every piece of jewelry you see out there costs enough to merit you having to re-mortgage your home or to pull off a Pink Panther-style heist in order to own it, though; in fact there are many ways to score a beautiful piece of jewelry without robbing a bank or pawnshop.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the best sources of low-cost jewelry that’s still beautiful and striking isn’t the high street but right from the comfort of your own home. The internet is a fantastic source of great jewelry pieces thanks to the abundance of retailers that sell their wares online. In fact, many online jewelry marketplaces have <a href="http://ejewelrydeals.com/daily-jewelry-deals.html">daily jewelry deals</a> that change every twenty-four hours, which means that if you don’t like what one site is offering on a given day you just need to wait a bit and see what they have in store for you tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>Luxury Without the High Price Tag</b></p>
<p>In addition to the internet as a source of affordable jewelry, there are other ways to find beautiful pieces of art to adorn your body that won’t cost an arm and a leg. Visiting your local thrift or consignment shops can yield serious treasures when it comes to jewelry with the added benefit of a low price tag, and antique dealers can also yield big finds at a fraction of the price that you might pay at a major retailer.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t feel like you’ve got to purchase something that’s worth thousands if you can find a similar item for much less because it’s made of less expensive materials. Antique rings and necklaces might not have the same cachet of a strand of pearls or a diamond-encrusted bracelet, but if you like the way it looks and it makes you feel good, who can put a price on your own self-worth?</p>

			<h2><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/why-you-shouldnt-be-scared-of-tens-therapy/">Why You Shouldn’t Be Scared of TENS Therapy</a></h2>
			<span class="postinfo">
				<span class="line"></span>

				<p><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tens.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104" alt="tens" src="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tens.jpg" width="280" height="239" /></a>If you’ve heard of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation, you’ve probably thought that it sounds like some sort of torture method used on James Bond after he’s captured by a criminal mastermind, but you couldn’t be more wrong about TENS therapy.</p>
<p><b>It’s Not Just For Supervillains</b></p>
<p>No, it’s not ripped from the pages of a pulp novel or a comic book – TENS therapy is real, and it’s a widely respected pain management technique. The idea of running an electric current through your body seems to be counter-intuitive when it comes to reducing pain – we’re taught from an early age not to touch an electrical socket, after all – but you’re not getting electrocuted. In fact, TENS therapy doesn’t even hurt.</p>
<p>TENS therapy doesn’t involve getting strapped into a gurney like you’ve seen in the movies. In fact, you simply apply the <a href="http://tensunitshop.com/" target="_blank">TENS unit pads</a>, a pair of electrodes, to the portion of your back where you feel the most pain, and then switch on the machine itself. Instantly a low-voltage current will jump from one electrode to the other, and in the process that current will also travel across the nearest cluster of nerves and disrupt the pain signals they routinely send up to your brain. It’s safe, painless, and results in a tingling sensation that many patients find quite pleasant after they get used to it.</p>
<p><b>It Just Works</b></p>
<p>TENS therapy isn’t something that’s new or something that only quacks and ‘holistic’ homeopathic medicine men talk their patients into trying; it’s a well-respected therapy and has been in use for years. The reason TENS therapy is used so widely is because it tends to work, and when it does work it does quite well in relieving pain symptoms – especially when it comes to lower back pain.</p>
<p>That isn’t to say that TENS therapy is for everyone. If you’re suffering from back pain because of a neurological condition, using a TENS unit has a higher probability to solve your problems than if you suffered a back injury, but even if you threw your back out picking up a heavy object or if you were in a bad car accident where you suffered whiplash doesn’t mean that using TENS therapy can’t relieve some of your pain as your body goes through the natural healing process. In the end, the only way to know if TENS therapy is for you is to try it, but if you’ve been holding back out because you fear it will be a painful experience or that you’re wary of allowing electricity to course through your body, rest assured that TENS therapy could be the missing piece of the pain management puzzle that you’ve been trying so desperately to find.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MP900309638.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-101" alt="house plans" src="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/MP900309638-300x214.jpg" width="300" height="214" /></a>If you need to get some work done on your house it can be a difficult and painful process just to find and select a contractor to undertake what needs to be done. There are a myriad of construction and rehabilitation contractors available to use, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and navigating the landscape of building contractors can be exceedingly difficult. However, there are some easy ways to select the right contractor for your job, no matter how big or small it may be.</p>
<p><b>Go to the Source</b></p>
<p>Many people simply go to the phone book and select the first name that looks good to them, but this can lead to any number of issues. At best you find someone who is an imperfect fit for your needs, necessitating call after call until you stumble upon the one contractor that will do the work reliably and affordably; at worst you get taken for a ride by an unscrupulous builder. Instead of trying your luck with the laws of probability, instead consider going straight to the source: one of the many trade industry bodies for the construction sector.</p>
<p>Contacting a trade industry body will help place you in contact with the types of contractors that specialize in the work you need done and also offers you some security in that membership in any of these industry bodies requires a contractor to adhere to strict rules of conduct. You won’t find any fly-by-night builders in the membership section of a trade body, as that kind of behavior simply isn’t tolerated.</p>
<p><b>Peer Review</b></p>
<p>If you want even more feedback as to a prospective contractor you’ve got your eye on will be a good fit for you, consider turning to the best tool a home-owner can use: the internet. Doing so can put you in contact with other people who have used the contractor in the past, and they can offer you their insight as to whether or not your choice may be up to the job.</p>
<p>There are even dedicated websites precisely for reviewing construction companies. For instance, a review site such as <a href="http://www.ploughcroftreviews.com/">Ploughcroft</a> features testimonials and reviews from clients that have dealt with the company, making it a much easier decision for anyone considering using them as well.</p>
<p><b>Get a Second Opinion</b></p>
<p>Finally, don’t neglect one of the most reliable resources you may have: close friends and family members. People you know and trust who have gone through the same process you’re going through right now can have valuable insight for you regarding their own experiences, and they could recommend you someone they’ve used in the past to great effect – or steer you clear of someone whose performance left them cold.</p>

Backpacking around the world? Going on an adventure?</em></p>
<p>If so, then you will most certainly want to read every single word contained in this article.</p>
<p>Here are 8 simple travel tips:</p>
<p><strong>Have the right supplies</strong></p>
<p>Are you going camping in the wilderness, or will you be spending a lot of time in an area where natural disasters are common?</p>
<p>In these scenarios, make sure you equip yourself with some <a href="http://www.tacticalvantage.com/en/153-survival-gear">emergency preparedness supplies</a> in case the worst ends up happening.</p>
<p><strong>Compare flights</strong></p>
<p>The best way to get the cheapest flights is use a comparison website online. This can easily save you hundreds of dollars on a single flight.</p>
<p><strong>Read about your destination</strong></p>
<p>Another travel tip to keep in mind, is to read about your destination before you go. Buy a guide book and learn about the local culture and customs.</p>
<p><strong>Secure your home</strong></p>
<p>Whenever you leave your home for an extended period of time, you must make sure everything is secure. Install a home security system, and ask friends or family to check on the house every few days.</p>
<p><strong>Know your budget</strong></p>
<p>Always set a budget before you set off on your travels. While it may be tempting to just spend and spend, think about how this may be harming your financial situation. Never put yourself deep in debt to go on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>Make a copy of your passport</strong></p>
<p>In some countries, police officials can stop you on the street and ask to see your passport. Instead of actually carrying your real passport, it&#8217;s a much better idea to make a copy and carry that. This way, you don&#8217;t risk losing your passport or having it stolen.</p>
<p><strong>Pack light</strong></p>
<p>The vast majority of travelers always end up packing a lot more than they need. Why get stuck with 3 heavy suitcases, when you could have packed light and become more mobile?</p>
<p><strong>Go in the off-season</strong></p>
<p>Looking to get away for a couple of weeks but are on a limited budget? If this the case, then why not consider going to a destination in the off-season?</p>
<p>For example, the South of Spain in December and January still has some nice weather, but without the hoards of tourists to contend with. Hotel prices will be cheaper, so you can easily grab yourself a bargain.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>We hope you have found these simple travel tips informative. Wherever you decide to go in the world, make sure you keep safe and have a good time.</p>

Nowadays, vaporizers are so small and compact that they can be small enough to fit in a pocket or a handbag, but it wasn’t always that way; here’s how vaporizers have evolved over the years to where they are now.</p>
<p><b>Great in Theory, but Not Exactly Practical</b></p>
<p>At first, vaporizers were large and bulky pieces of machinery that featured large, over sized chambers and heating elements and required power from a wall socket in order to operate. The heating element inside the vaporization chamber was large and inefficient; while it reached the needed temperature to release the compounds inside the chamber, it worked on conduction, which tended to add an acrid, unpleasant taste to the vapor it produced, making vaporizers more of an expensive piece of experimental industry than the type of object you would be able to enjoy reliably. The delivery system for the vapor also involved long tubes or even filling balloons with the vapor, making it an ungainly and cumbersome experience, and the sheer bulk of the vaporizers of yesterday made it a trial to transport.</p>
<p><b>The Wonders of Modern Technology</b></p>
<p>Today, many of the problems inherent in these first-generation vaporizers have been solved. Vaporizers have become smaller and less obtrusive, and the materials used as a heating block have become refined to the point where convection-based heating could be used, allowing the vapor released to be free of any burned or acrid taste. On top of that, miniaturization technology has progressed to the point where true portability has been achieved, and now websites such as <a href="http://www.vapetropolis.ca/handheld-portable-vaporizers">Vapetropolis</a> offer a wide array of truly portable vaporizers that are small enough to slip into a pocket or a handbag.</p>
<p>Portable vaporizers are also much safer and easier to use than their older, bulkier cousins; thanks to newer, more efficient materials and breakthroughs in insulation, portable vaporizers can remain completely cool to the touch even as their internal chambers are blazing hot. Even better is how the modern portable vaporizer is indeed completely wireless, as the same rechargeable battery technology used by mobile phones are used to power the heating element inside. Many portable vaporizers even feature USB chargers like your smart phone, making it easy to keep your vaporizer charged until you need it.</p>

Here are 10 quick tips to keep in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Ignore the phone</strong></p>
<p>Does your stalker constantly call you? In this scenario, try and ignore the phone as much as possible, and never engage in any kind of conversation with your stalker.</p>
<p><strong>Call the police</strong></p>
<p>When you feel like you&#8217;re in danger, call the police immediately. It is their duty to look into the situation, and even arrest your stalker if they have broken the law.</p>
<p><strong>Get a home security system</strong></p>
<p>In order to give yourself that extra peace of mind when at home, you should seriously consider installing a home security system. Search for some <a href="http://www.top-home-security-systems.net/protect-america-reviews/">protect america reviews</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Tell friends and family</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t go through this ordeal alone. Tell your friends and family what is happening, so they can offer some much needed support and advice.</p>
<p><strong>Get a big dog</strong></p>
<p>Are you an animal lover? If so, then why not get a big dog to patrol the property and keep you feeling more secure at night? Your stalker would be stupid to make a move when a vicious dog is there waiting.</p>
<p><strong>Be careful when out alone</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s never a good idea to go out walking the streets alone. Instead, try and drive as much as possible, and always keep the car doors locked.</p>
<p><strong>Keep a log</strong></p>
<p>Record all the events that happen. If your stalker calls you late at night, write it down. If they turn up outside your house, write it down.</p>
<p><strong>Collect evidence</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a good idea to collect as much evidence as possible. Consider using a video camera to film your stalker, and even record phone calls. This kind of evidence can be used in court at a later date if you need to get a restraining order.</p>
<p><strong>Change your routine</strong></p>
<p>Keeping the same routine day in day out is not a good idea. This makes it easier for your stalker to follow you, and even anticipate where you are going to be. Change your routine as much as possible so you don&#8217;t become predictable.</p>
<p><strong>Stay calm</strong></p>
<p>Although this is not a nice situation to find yourself in, it&#8217;s essential that you stay as calm as possible. If you start freaking out all of the time, then this will lead to rash decisions you might end up regretting later.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MP900302994.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-88" alt="law scales" src="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MP900302994-214x300.jpg" width="214" height="300" /></a>It may be tempting to seek legal advice from the largest and most prominent legal firm you can think of if you’re in need of their services, but you could easily be doing yourself a disservice if you don’t first investigate the law firms local to your area first – you could be missing out on the best legal representation you could find!</p>
<p><b>Bigger is Not Always Better</b></p>
<p>Just because a law firm is a massive multinational institution with law offices in every major city around the globe doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s going to be a good fit for your needs. Large law firms of that type are almost universally successful – they wouldn’t have grown so large if they weren’t – but sometimes that huge multinational firm is not going to provide you the same personal attention that you would get from a smaller firm.</p>
<p>To many massive law firms, you’re little more than a case number. The managing partners of a firm are off in some central office somewhere, while you’re dealing with an associate or a case manager that might have never meet with his or her boss, let alone have a conversation and discuss the particulars of your case. Instead, a local law firm is likely to be a much more intimate experience. It will have ties to the local community in a way that a multinational firm never will, providing a much more personalized service than you would otherwise get at a giant legal firm.</p>
<p><b>It’s Not as Hard to Find As You Might Think</b></p>
<p>The visibility of a major law firm is most likely its biggest asset in that the brand is an easily recognizable one. Everyone knows the name and what they’re good at, and it’s this ubiquity that draws prospective clients into their offices. Smaller local firms don’t have this advantage, but that doesn’t mean that they’re excessively hard to find.</p>
<p>In fact, thanks to the wonders of the modern age – specifically the internet – it’s easier than ever to find a law firm that caters precisely to your specific needs. Whether it’s corporate law, personal injury, or divorce proceedings there are ways to find the best local firm for you right on the internet. An excellent example of how specific these websites can be is the local resource site for finding personal injury solicitors located in Dublin; a quick perusal of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.personalinjurysolicitorsdublin.info/no-win-no-fee/&amp;usd=2&amp;usg=ALhdy2-HG_RC1owR_fjzSO63muMv2z6q4A" target="_blank">http://www.personalinjurysolicitorsdublin.info/no-win-no-fee/</a> can help a Dubliner get into contact with that no win no fee solicitor they need to help them prevail in their accident claim, and there are similar sites all across the world according to your locality.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MP900422179.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-85" alt="Young Graduates boys and girls" src="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MP900422179-300x262.jpg" width="300" height="262" /></a>Going away to college can be one of the most rewarding and fun times in a young person’s life, but only if you know what you’re doing and do your best to strive towards success and happiness. Here are two keys to that success that can unlock your inner potential while you’re pursuing a college degree.</p>
<p><b>Everything in Moderation, Including Moderation</b></p>
<p>Man does not live on bread alone, and likewise do college students need to do more than simply wake up, go to classes, come home, and study for the rest of the day. You can easily complete your work in a way that is outstanding and exemplary and still have plenty of time left over to enjoy yourself from time to time, so don’t shut yourself up in the library or your dorm room until you forget what sunlight feels like or how fresh air smells.</p>
<p>That being said, you need to make sure you don’t spend too much time having fun and not enough time on your studies. It’s all too easy to be distracted by a whole new world of social opportunities when you go away to school, but just because you can spend every night out until 4 in the morning doesn’t mean that you should, or that you even can sustain that for very long. There’s a time and a place for everything, including having a good time: it’s the reason God invented Friday and Saturday nights, after all, so just make sure to balance the things you want to do against the things you need to do and you’ll reap the rewards.</p>
<p><b>Be Careful With Your Cash</b></p>
<p>It’s all too easy to spend money on frivolous objects while you’re off at school, but you’ve got to keep in mind that money still doesn’t grow on trees and that you need to get that cash from somewhere. If you have a part-time job to help out with your finances, make sure you pay for everything you need to before you go out and spend money on things that don’t further your college career – buy those expensive textbooks before you the plane tickets to Miami for Spring Break!</p>
<p>If you’re already up to your ears in debt because you’ve taken out massive student loans to pay for your college classes, the answer is never to take out even more loans if you need help paying for books or rent on a dorm room or off-campus apartment. Instead, look into sources of extra cash that don’t cost you anything but time and effort: a site like <a href="http://grants4college.com/">Grants4College</a> can open up the world of grants and scholarships to you, offering you information on how and where to apply for these monetary gifts that can provide some relief for your needs without requiring you to amass even more debt that you’ll just have to pay back eventually.</p>

			<h2><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/causes-of-heartburn-and-how-to-treat-it/">Causes of Heartburn and How to Treat It</a></h2>
			<span class="postinfo">
				<span class="line"></span>
				Posted  by <a href="http://www.mum2010.org/author/admin/" title="Posts by admin" rel="author">admin</a> in <a href="http://www.mum2010.org/category/health/" title="View all posts in Health" rel="category tag">Health</a>				<span class="line"></span>

					</div>
				<p><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MP900430501.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-81" alt="ill woman in bed" src="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MP900430501-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>Heartburn can be a mild inconvenient annoyance or it can be a painfully debilitating condition that negatively affects your quality of life. However, before you can treat heartburn, you need to know what can cause it.</p>
<p><b>An Ounce of Prevention</b></p>
<p>It’s called heartburn because it feels like there are hot coals right under your breastbone, even though your heart has nothing to do with why you’re feeling like you could breathe fire at any given moment. Instead, most instances of heartburn occur because excess digestive acid has splashed up out of your stomach and into your esophagus, causing pain and irritation to the sensitive tissues there.</p>
<p>The opening of your esophagus that leads to your stomach should in most cases stay nice and closed. There’s a lower esophageal sphincter there, and its job is to keep the esophagus as a one-way road – food goes down and nothing comes back up – but if something weakens that muscle or if it doesn’t close completely, the results could be leaving it exposed to stomach acid.</p>
<p>That’s where the trouble starts. Suddenly you’ve got this burning irritation in your chest and it’s all because you’ve got an open pathway between your esophagus and your stomach. This can be caused by any number of things, but the biggest culprit is your diet: if you’re eating too much or if you’re eating the wrong types of foods, your lower esophageal sphincter relaxes, paving the way for heartburn. Much of preventing heartburn is simply eating more modestly and staying away from foods known to relax that muscle like coffee, tomatoes and alcohol.</p>
<p><b>A Pound of Cure</b></p>
<p>Of course once you’ve got heartburn, it’ a bit too late at that point – the horses have all escaped, so it’s little use in closing up the barn now! This is why there are so many medications on the market that are designed to relieve heartburn symptoms.</p>
<p>However, not every heartburn treatment is created equal. For every antacid or proton pump inhibitor on the market, there’s an herbal or natural remedy that purportedly does the same thing. Many of these may not do what they say on the tin, or may only work well at first and lose their efficacy over time; what’s important is to choose the right one for you.</p>
<p>If you seldom suffer from heartburn, a simple antacid may be the best option for you. Antacids neutralize the amount of digestive acid in your stomach and tend to work quickly for isolated incidents. If you’d rather go the natural route, an herbal remedy such as <a href="http://betterhealthx.com/heartburn-no-more-review">Heartburn No More</a>, which uses apple cider vinegar to naturally balance your stomach acid levels, may be more your speed. Finally if you’re a chronic heartburn sufferer you may need time to allow your esophagus to heal. A proton pump inhibitor, which actually shuts down your stomach acid production, may be your best option for long-term relief.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this doesn&#8217;t need to be a difficult or expensive task. Find out how with our 8 simple skin care tips.</p>
<p><strong>Understand your skin type</strong></p>
<p>To get the best results, it&#8217;s important that you understand your skin type. For example, if you have oily skin, then you need to buy products that are directed towards this type of skin.</p>
<p><strong>Stay hydrated</strong></p>
<p>Aim to drink as much water as possible so you can stay hydrated throughout the day. This is great for your skin, as water flushes out harmful toxins from your body.</p>
<p><strong>Wash your skin twice a day</strong></p>
<p>Experts recommend washing your skin twice a day for maximum results. Wash your body in the shower with a good shower gel, and use a face wash for your face. Also, it&#8217;s a good idea to not use very hot water, as this can damage the skin. Instead, try to keep the water lukewarm.</p>
<p><strong>Be gentle</strong></p>
<p>Avoid scrubbing your skin too hard or being too rough. For example, when you get out of the shower, pat yourself dry rather than harshly scrubbing your body.</p>
<p><strong>Get a good moisturizer</strong></p>
<p>If your skin often gets dry or appears cracked, then a good moisturizer will help. Just make sure that you choose a well known brand, and check to see if the moisturizer uses mostly natural ingredients.</p>
<p><strong>Watch your skin in the sun</strong></p>
<p>One of the hidden dangers to your skin is the sun. It doesn&#8217;t even need to be that hot, or you don&#8217;t have to spend that much time in the sun for damage to occur.</p>
<p>With this in mind, buy a good sun cream and apply it every time you go out. Not only that, but you should also buy a good pair of sunglasses so you can protect your eyes from harmful UV rays.</p>
<p><strong>Get plenty of sleep</strong></p>
<p>At the end of a long day, your skin needs time to repair itself. This is why you should always look to get plenty of sleep, so you can wake up feeling refreshed with great looking skin every morning.</p>
<p><strong>Visit your doctor</strong></p>
<p>If you are concerned about any skin conditions or unusual marks on your skin, then you should visit your doctor as soon as possible. It&#8217;s probably nothing to be concerned about, but it never hurts to check.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MP900448334.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-75" alt="stomes" src="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MP900448334-199x300.jpg" width="199" height="300" /></a>No matter If you want to get rid of stress, gain peace of mind, <a href="http://www.consciousnessjunkie.com/manifest-absolutely-anything-v2-0-review-rishan-b">manifest absolutely anything</a> or lower your blood pressure&#8230;meditation can help.</p>
<p>If you are new to meditation and are keen to find out more, then make sure you pay full attention to the important information below&#8230;</p>
<p>It all starts with being alone</p>
<p>Make no mistake about, meditation is a solitary activity. If you are trying to meditate with other people around, then you will have trouble reaching your inner state.</p>
<p>For this reason, find a place where you can be alone and not be distracted for a while. Unplug the phone, turn off your cell, and ignore the outside world for a bit.</p>
<p>You then need to get comfortable</p>
<p>In order to meditate properly, you will need to get comfortable. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you are sitting or lying down, just make sure your body is comfortable and able to get relaxed. Some people like to lie down on the bed, while others find it easier to get comfortable in a chair.</p>
<p>Decide how long you are going to meditate for</p>
<p>Experiment with different meditation sessions. You will want to find the perfect length for your needs. If you are pressed for time, or you have another engagement in 30 minutes, then make sure you set a timer so you don&#8217;t have to keep looking at your watch.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it doesn&#8217;t matter if your meditation session is short or long, as long as you receive some kind of benefit from the session.</p>
<p>Focus on your breath and clear your mind</p>
<p>One of the main complaints about meditation is being unable to get rid of unwanted thoughts. When this happens, you should look to focus on your breathing.</p>
<p>Inhale through your nose deep from the stomach, and then hold it a few seconds before you exhale slowly. Keep doing this until your mind becomes clear and focused.</p>
<p>You should try to meditate on a regular basis</p>
<p>As with anything else in life, the more you meditate, the better you will become. Ideally, you should be able to have a meditation session every day, but this is not always possible.</p>
<p>As a minimum, aim for at least 4 sessions a week, so you don&#8217;t allow your mind to get out of shape.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this ultimate guide to meditation. You might find it hard at first, but stick with it, and in no time at all you will be able to easily meditate your mind into a deeper state.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MP900402508.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-72" alt="work at home" src="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MP900402508-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>Do you like the idea of being your own boss and working from home? If so, then you should pay attention to the 6 proven ideas below. Choose one idea, stick with it for a few months, and you should start to see profits.</p>
<p><strong>Start a blog</strong></p>
<p>It seems that everybody is starting their own blogs these days. Simply choose a topic that you are passionate about, start writing some content, and then get traffic from the Google search engine. You can then earn cash from home by recommending affiliate products and running banner ads on your site.</p>
<p><strong>Partner with YouTube</strong></p>
<p>Video is definitely the future of the internet. The biggest video site is YouTube, where millions of videos are uploaded daily.</p>
<p>So how do you make money on YouTube? It&#8217;s simple really. Just start creating your own videos around a particular topic, and then promote related affiliate offers in the description.</p>
<p><strong>Partner with Amazon</strong></p>
<p>Another huge website is Amazon, and you can get a piece of the pie by becoming an Amazon affiliate and then promoting their products.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is by starting your own review website. As an example, your website could be about camping, where you review different camping equipment and then refer visitors through your Amazon affiliate link so they can buy the products.</p>
<p><strong>Import and export</strong></p>
<p>If you could buy a product in China for $10, and then sell it in America for $80&#8230;how many would you buy? The import business is very hot right now, and it offers you a great opportunity to earn cash from home.</p>
<p>The best part is this: You don&#8217;t have to actually handle any of the products or do any of the shipping! Instead, hire a dropshipping company to do all of the dirty work, and then you just collect the checks. It really can&#8217;t get any simpler than that.</p>
<p><strong>Create your own info products</strong></p>
<p>Another great way to earn cash from home is by creating your own info products.</p>
<p>Here is what you do. Go to a site like Clickbank where there are thousands of digital info products listed in the marketplace, and then find a product that is selling like hotcakes. Ideally, it should be a product that solves a desperate problem or offers some kind of solution.</p>
<p>Then, create your own version of that product, get some affiliates, and you are in business!</p>
<p><strong>Using Sports Expertize<br />
</strong></p>
<p>If you are interested in sports and don&#8217;t mind taking on a bit of risk, then sports betting could be an excellent way for you to earn cash from home. The quickest way to get started is to <a href="http://www.bangthebook.com">Visit BangTheBook</a></p>

				<p><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MP900414104.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-69" alt="Graduates " src="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MP900414104-300x259.jpg" width="300" height="259" /></a>University should be a fun and exciting time. However, for most students, this is not the case, as they struggle financially and become deep in debt.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want this to happen to you while at university, then don&#8217;t make the following 8 financial mistakes!</p>
<p><strong>Not shopping online</strong></p>
<p>No matter if you need a new textbook or a cell phone case, you should buy online for the cheapest prices. As an example, <a href="http://www.i-adapters.com/collections/iphone-5c-cases">i-Adapters.com</a> offer the cheapest cell phone accessories in the industry, so pick yourself up a bargain right away.</p>
<p><strong>Not having a job</strong></p>
<p>Sure, you need to focus on your studies, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t get a part time job to improve your finances. Even 10 hours a week will give you a much needed cash injection.</p>
<p><strong>Not using a bike</strong></p>
<p>Do you really need an expensive car, or to use public transportation every day? Instead, buy a second hand bike and you can travel everywhere for free. It will also help you stay in shape.</p>
<p><strong>Not having a budget</strong></p>
<p>You need to know exactly where your money is going every month. It&#8217;s all too easy to simply waste money and then wonder where it all went. With this in mind, set a monthly budget and then stick to it.</p>
<p><strong>Not taking advantage of student discounts</strong></p>
<p>One of the main perks of being a student is that many places will offer you a discount. For this reason, do a little research to find out exactly what you are entitled to, and then start saving some money.</p>
<p>Not cooking your meals</p>
<p>Ordering pizzas and visiting the local kebab shop might seem convenient, but is it really the best way to spend your money? Of course not. This is why you should try and cook from scratch as much as possible, so you can save money and eat healthier at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Partying every night</strong></p>
<p>One of the major mistakes that most university students make is going out every night to party. Sure, this can be a lot of fun, but in the end it will leave you broke, and even deep in debt. This is why you should only go out a couple of nights a week, and when you do go out, make sure you keep an eye on how much you are spending.</p>
<p><strong>Not buying second hand books</strong></p>
<p>Do you really need to buy your books brand new? It&#8217;s usually really easy to find second hand books around campus, for a fraction of the price.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MP900382977.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-66" alt="contractor drilling" src="http://www.mum2010.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MP900382977-214x300.jpg" width="214" height="300" /></a>As you are no doubt aware, the building industry gets a lot of bad press and negative attention. That&#8217;s not to say there aren&#8217;t any decent building contractors out there, it&#8217;s just that the rogue companies always seem to get all of the headlines.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid hiring a building contractor that will make your life a living nightmare, then you should pay attention to the following 6 common mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Not checking reviews</strong></p>
<p>These days, it&#8217;s extremely easy to check reviews of building contractors by going online. Simply perform a quick search in Google, or visit a site like <a href="http://www.contractor-place.com">Contractor Place</a> to find out everything you need to know.</p>
<p><strong>Not asking for references</strong></p>
<p>Any legitimate building contractor should have many different references which they will happily show you. If a contractor doesn&#8217;t have any references, then this is a good sign that you should stay well clear and look elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Not asking about qualifications</strong></p>
<p>Would you hire a lawyer who has not gone to law school? The same thing applies in the building industry.</p>
<p>These days, there is no excuse for a building contractor not to have some qualifications under their belt. If they don&#8217;t have qualifications, then there is a good chance they don&#8217;t really know what they are doing, or they are just trying to make a quick buck.</p>
<p><strong>Not getting a written agreement</strong></p>
<p>Quite simply, if you don&#8217;t get a written agreement between yourself and the contractor, then you are putting you and your property at great risk.</p>
<p>With this in mind, only hire a building contractor that is happy to put everything in writing. This includes the price, the work to be carried out, and the time-frame in which the job should be completed.</p>
<p><strong>Not checking for insurance</strong></p>
<p>In many States, it is required by law that building contractors have liability insurance. This means that should they cause damage to your property, then you will be covered. Hire a building contractor without liability insurance, and you could be in for a whole world of trouble. Don&#8217;t take the risk.</p>
<p><strong>Not getting a written guarantee</strong></p>
<p>If you buy a product from the store and it&#8217;s faulty, then you can take it back for a replacement or refund. The same principle should apply in the building industry. Always get a written guarantee from the contractor, so if the job is not to your liking, they can&#8217;t just leave you high and dry.</p>
