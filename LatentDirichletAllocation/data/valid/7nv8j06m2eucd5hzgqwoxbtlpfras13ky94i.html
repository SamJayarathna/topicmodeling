									<p>SAVCBS is concerned with the application of formal techniques to the specification and verification of component-based systems. Component-based systems are a growing concern for the software engineering community. Specification and reasoning techniques are urgently needed to permit composition of systems from components. Component-based specification and verification is also vital for scaling advanced verification techniques such as extended static analysis and model checking to the size of real systems. The workshop will consider formalization of both functional and non-functional behavior, such as performance or reliability.</p>

									<h2>Workshop on Self-Managed Systems '04</h2>

									<p>Web site URL: <a title="WOSS&nbsp;Web site" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7egarlan/woss04/"><span class="under">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~garlan/woss04/</span></a></p>
									<h2>Important Dates:</h2>
									<p>Paper submission: August 16<br>

										Camera-ready papers: October 1</p>
									<h2>Workshop Organizers:</h2>

									<p>An increasingly important requirement for software-based systems is the ability to adapt themselves at run time to handle such things as resource variability, changing user needs, and system faults. The topic of self-managed systems has been studied in a large number of specific areas, including robotics planning software, control systems, programming language design, software architecture, trustworthy computing, and neural networks.</p>
									<p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss the fundamental principles, state of the art, and critical challenges of self-managed systems. Specifically, we intend to focus on the software engineering aspects, including the software languages, techniques and mechanisms that can be used to support dynamic, self-adaptive behavior.</p>

									<p>Collecting and analyzing software process data can help to control and predict the performance of software development activities, helping software developers to achieve both business and technical objectives. Experience has shown that quantifying the software process operation can improve insight, e.g. allowing assessing the impact of process change on the software products.</p>
									<p>On the other hand, the widespread adoption of agile processes and the increasing structural diversity of software development organizations around the world as well as new concerns e.g. about privacy, are driving the need for non-intrusive, cost-effective methods capable to deliver long term success in collecting process data without further increasing the burden of process management. Process data mining techniques are also being investigated aimed at extracting valuable knowledge, capable to improve software products' quality.</p>
									<p>This workshop is aimed at highlighting the cutting edge of process data collection and analysis research, fostering information exchange between researchers working on data analysis for agile software process improvement and practitioners interested in exploiting software data collection and analysis techniques as a basis for making process decisions and predicting process performance.</p>

									<p>This workshop aims to formulate a research agenda for addressing the future of software engineering as an interdisciplinary activity. Driven by the spirit of scientific enquiry, the software engineering community should transcend the boundaries of the discipline and take a broader and possibly more radical view about future software engineering techniques, processes and tools. A number of disciplines share common problems with software engineering, and some may have developed answers which are useful for us. Apart from the direct benefit of solving a particular problem, the process of transfer will help us to create a vision of future software engineering by identifying assumptions which might be challenged in an inter-disciplinary context. To achieve this, participants in the workshop will describe experiences where techniques or approaches from other disciplines were successfully used within software engineering research or practice, and suggest areas where further research may help such an interdisciplinary transfer. Discussions will be supported by an organising Framework classifying existing and potential inter-disciplinary transfers such as cognitive design of representations; financial and economic models; service-based organisational principles; mass-customisation and product lines; and holistic human-centred view of software engineering. Developed through a number of preceding activities, we expect this framework to continue evolving and constitute one of the main outputs of this workshop together with the workshop proceedings.</p>
