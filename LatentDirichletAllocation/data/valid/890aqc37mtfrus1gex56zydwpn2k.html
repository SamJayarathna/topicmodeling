			<li><i>September 17, 2007.</i> ICER 2007 has come and gone. Slides from the talks have been posted on the conference program page.  The program committee and all of us at Georgia Tech thank everyone for their participation.  We look forward to see everyone next year at the <a href="http://www.uts.edu.au/" class="bodylink">University of Technology in Sydney, Australia</a> for <a href="http://www.newcastle.edu.au/conference/icer2008/index.html" class="bodylink">ICER 2008</a>.
			<li><i>September 14, 2007:</i> ICER is here!  Please note banquet information is now posted, and a new map reflecting the banquet location is available (maps are available at the Wyndham front desk and will also be in conference packets).
			<li><i>September 1, 2007:</i> To get free wireless access at the conference hotel, you will need to be a member of Wyndham's  ByRequest program.  See the hotel information page for more details.
			<li><i>August 14, 2007:</i> The early bird registration deadline has been extended to September 14th to compensate for the late availability of the registration system.  The late registration price will only be charged to those who pay at packet pickup the day of the conference.

<p>Computing education, as a research discipline, is the study of how people come to understand computational processes and devices, and how to improve that understanding. As computation becomes ubiquitous in our world, understanding of computing in order to design, structure, maintain, and utilize these technologies becomes increasingly important--both for the technology professional, but also for the technologically literate citizen. The research study of how the understanding of computation develops, and how to improve that understanding, is critically important for the technology-dependent societies in which we live.

<p><b>Learning:</b> Computing education is naturally concerned with how students make sense of computational processes and devices in formal education, including primary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions. Computing education also goes beyond formal education. What do adults understand about computation, and how do they come to that understanding? What do children understand about computation given their limited conceptions of time, process, and agency, and how does that affect their later formal learning about computation?

<p><b>Instruction:</b> Learning may be enhanced or impeded by instruction. Educators bring instructional methods, formal or informal theories, and values to specific learning environments and situations. As researchers we explore the educators' role in the learning process--whether that educator is a teacher, near-peer, remote resource or the computer itself.

<p>Computing Education Research employs methodologies from many fields, amongst them psychology, education, anthropology and statistics. As a consequence, research is frequently characterized by a diversity of methodological approaches; these may be applied directly, or may be combined and modified to suit the particular cross-disciplinary questions that we ask.
